<p>Let’s discuss: What is reproducible research for you? Have you ever
experienced issues while trying to reproduce someone else’s study or
even your own research?</p>
<p>Reproducible studies allow other researchers to perform the same
processes and analyses to produce results identical to the initial
researcher’s. Original researchers have to make available the study’s
associated data, documentation, and code pipelines and workflows in a
way that is sufficiently self-explanatory and well-documented so that
independent investigators can reproduce/recreate the original study
under the same conditions, using identical materials and procedures, and
ultimately achieve consistent results and render equal outcomes.
Original investigators, therefore, must produce rich and detailed
documentation for themselves and others. This includes fully specifying
all steps taken in the study in human-readable and computer-executable
ways.</p>

<li>A group of researchers obtained great results and submitted their

National Science Foundation (NSF)</a> subcommittee on replicability in
science (2015):</p>
<p>Science should routinely evaluate the reproducibility of findings
that enjoy a prominent role in the published literature. To make
reproduction possible, efficient, and informative, researchers should
sufficiently document the details of the procedures used to collect
data, convert observations into analyzable data, and perform data
analysis.</p>
<p>Reproducibility refers to the ability of a researcher to duplicate
the results of a prior study using the same materials as those used by
the original investigator. That is, a second researcher might use the
same raw data to build the same analysis files and implement the same
statistical analysis in an attempt to yield the same results.
Reproducibility is a minimum necessary condition for a finding to be
considered rigorous, believable, and informative.</p>

<p>Many studies claim results that cannot be reproduced. This problem
has attracted increased attention in recent years, with supporting
evidence that research is often not reproducible. A 2016 survey in
Nature revealed that irreproducible experiments are a problem across all
domains of science:</p>

with “good enough” computational practices,
replicability/robustness/generalizability of scientific findings are an
even greater concern involving research misconduct, questionable

</h3>
<p>Let’s assume I have convinced you that reproducibility and
transparency are in your best interest. Then what is the best time to
worry about it?</p>
<p>From day one and throughout the whole research life cycle! Before
starting the project, you might have to learn tools like R or Git. If
you wait too long while doing the analysis, you might lose a lot of time
trying to remember what you did two months ago. When you write the
paper, you want up-to-date numbers, tables, and figures. When you
co-author a paper, you want to make sure that the analyses presented in
a paper with your name on it are sound. When you review a paper, you
can’t judge the results if you don’t know how the authors got there.</p>
<p><a href="https://rohanalexander.github.io/telling_stories-published" class="external-link">Alexander
(2023)</a> argues that reproducibility often starts out as a
burden—something others require of you, and it can feel tedious or
frustrating. But that perception usually changes the moment you return
to a project after some time away. Then, it becomes clear that
reproducibility isn’t just essential for advancing data science—it’s
also a practical tool that makes your own work easier to understand and
build upon later. To achieve reproducibility, the author suggests a
three-step approach:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Ensure the entire workflow is documented. This may involve
addressing questions such as:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>How was the raw dataset obtained, and is access likely to be
persistent and available to others?</li>
<li>What specific steps are being taken to transform the raw data into
the data that was analyzed, and how can this be made available to
others?</li>
<li>What analysis has been done, which codes/scripts were used, and how
can this be shared clearly?</li>
<li>How has the final paper or report been built, and to what extent can
others follow that process themselves?</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Try to progressively accomplish the following requirements:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Can you run your entire workflow again?</li>
<li>Can another person run your entire workflow again?</li>
<li>Can “future-you” run your entire workflow again?</li>
<li>Can “future-another-person” run your entire workflow again?</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Include a discussion about the limitations of the dataset, methods,
and workflows in the final paper or report.</li>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R and
other programming languages, such as Python, that provide many tools to
support code development. It includes a console syntax highlighting
editor that supports direct code execution and tools for plotting,
history, debugging, collaboration, and workspace management. Writing
scripts to conduct your analysis is a powerful way to weave
reproducibility principles throughout the entire research lifecycle,
from data gathering to the statistical analysis, presentation, and
publication of results.</p>

<h3 id="it-is-free-and-open-source">It is free and open-source<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#it-is-free-and-open-source"></a>
</h3>
<p>Reproducibility becomes more complex and opaque when results rely on
proprietary software. Unless the research code is open-source,
reproducing results on different software/hardware configurations is
impossible. Rstudio is dedicated to sustainable investment in free and
open-source software for data science.</p>

</h3>
<p>When you create a new script, the windows/panes within your RStudio
session adjust automatically so you can see both your script and the
results in your console when you run your syntax. It also allows calling
up potential syntax options while writing using the tab key.</p>

<p>RStudio has a handy “Environment” window, which shows all of the
objects you have stored, including data, scalars, vectors, matrices,
model outputs, etc., along with a summary of the information stored in
those objects.</p>

<p>With RStudio, you can navigate to folders on your computer in the
“Files” window, view any files you have in that folder, or go to your
working directory. You can create projects that help you set your
working directory and work with relative paths to external files (such
as input data and figures), so it can also be used on other
machines.</p>

<p>Another great advantage of using RStudio for your R project is that
the platform integrates with the version control system <a href="https://git-scm.com/" class="external-link">git</a> and code repository service <a href="https://github.com" class="external-link">GitHub</a>” Once you connect RStudio with a
repository on GitHub (remote) you can bring its content to your local
machine, update it, and share changes in a streamlined way. In git
jargon, it enables you to <code>push</code> and <code>pull</code>
commits to GitHub, allowing seamless collaboration and effective version
control. RStudio also provides tools to render documents (html, pdf,
etc.) directly from Rmarkdown and Quarto notebooks and instantly
connects with <a href="https://rpubs.com/" class="external-link">Rpubs</a> and <a href="https://quartopub.com/" class="external-link">Quarto Pub</a> for easy R project web
publishing. It is beyond the scope of this workshop, but Quarto also
allows you create slides, websites, books and much more. Visit the <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/gallery" class="external-link">Quarto Gallery</a> to feel

<p>We will talk more about what Quarto is in the next episode. Still, in
a nutshell, quarto documents enable you to blend your analysis and the
story associated with it by mixing text (using the markdown syntax) and
executable code. You can render those documents in various formats
(HTML, Docx, etc.), binding documentation, code, and outputs such as
figures. It is an excellent vector for reproducibility as it makes it
easy to update your results according to new information. For example,
if you find new data, you can re-render the Quarto with the latest data,
and the plots and other computed outputs will update accordingly.</p>

<div class="callout-content">
<p>As noted before, Quarto is the next generation of R Markdown, and the
anatomy of <code>.rmd</code> and <code>.qmd</code> files is very
similar. So why move to Quarto? While compatible with Python (and bash,
Julia, C, SQL), R Markdown was designed primarily for R users.
<strong>Quarto does not require R.</strong> It supports multiple
languages by delegating code execution to external engines, such as
Jupyter for Python and Julia, or knitr for R. This design helps support
cross-language workflows and reduces infrastructure dependencies. In
addition, because Quarto is designed to be compatible with existing
formats, you can render most existing <code>.Rmd</code> and Jupyter
Notebooks in Quarto without modification. This helps ease the transition
to Quarto.</p>

<p>The ability to integrate code and narratives is a major advantage of
Quarto and the RStudio environment, especially considering the
scientific process is naturally incremental, and many projects start
life as random notes, some code, then a manuscript, and eventually,
everything ends up a bit mixed together. To complicate things further,
we often work with other collaborators, lab members, graduate students,
and faculty from the same or different institutions, which makes it that
much more difficult to keep projects organized. When you throw data into
the mix (sometimes huge amounts of it!), it’s integral to use best
practices to maintain the integrity of your analysis and to be able to
publish high-quality and reproducible research. Quarto is a powerful
tool that can’t be fully utilized unless your project documents, scripts
and other files are well-organized. So, let’s take a look at RStudio’s
features for managing projects and discuss some of the best practices
when working with data and collaborators.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>We often have organizational or logistical stress points in our
research that may become breaking points, especially when it comes to
working with collaborators, returning to a project after a hiatus, or
dealing with data and scripts. Let’s discuss three of those common
stress points:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>File/folder disorganization</strong>
<ul>
<li>You cannot find your files on your computer (or your cloud
storage)</li>
<li>Multiple versions of files with names such as
“finaldraft_4.txt”</li>
<li>Path issues when trying to run code</li>
<li>Reviewers or colleagues cannot re-run your code/analyses</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Storage and sharing issues</strong>
<ul>
<li>Files are only saved to your computer and are vulnerable (or have
already succumbed to computer/hard drive failure</li>
<li>When working with collaborators, they (or you) don’t share the files
needed</li>
<li>Files are shared via email attachments</li>
<li>Difficult to know if you have the latest version of documents</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Losing track of project status</strong>
<ul>
<li>You cannot remember where you are in a project after being away for
an extended period (or what you worked on the previous day…no
judgment)</li>
<li>You aren’t sure what you should be working on next</li>
<li>You have various to-do notes spread across your office or home (or
never write them down in the first place)</li>

<p>In <code>CC-101_1_data.csv</code>, the <code>-</code> is used as part
of the keyword shared between several files. the <code>_</code>
separates it from the trial number and description. If one were to split
the filename on the <code>_</code>, the keyword would be maintained, and
the trial number would be separated out. In the
<code>2022-01-01_data_analyses.R</code>, the dash character
<code>-</code> is used for a date delimiter between year, month, and
day. The underscore character <code>_</code> is used between the words.
This allows us to split on underscore <code>_</code>, which would
preserve the date (separate from other file info).</p>

<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="use-relative-paths">
<strong>Use relative paths</strong><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#use-relative-paths"></a>
</h4>
<p>This goes hand-in-hand with keeping your project within one “root”
directory. If you use complete paths to, say, read your data to RStudio
and then share your code with a collaborator, they won’t be able to run
it because the complete path you used is unique to your system, and they
will receive an error that the file is not found. That is why one should
always use relative paths to link to other files in the project, i.e.,
“Where is my data file in relation to the script I’m reading the data
into?”. The practice of using relative paths is made easier by having a
directory set up and keeping all project files within one root project
folder.</p>
<p>Assuming your R script is in a <code>code</code> directory and your
data file is in a <code>data</code> directory, then an example of a
relative path to read your data would be:</p>
<pre><code><span><span class="va">df</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">read.csv</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="st">"../data/foodchoice_budgetlines.csv"</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Whereas a complete path might look like:</p>
<p>Windows:</p>
<pre><code><span><span class="va">df</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">read.csv</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="st">"C:/Users/wilma/Desktop/project23/data/foodchoice_budgetlines.csv"</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>If the example were on a Mac or Linux computer, you would have
<code>home</code> instead of <code>C:</code></p>
<p>In the complete path example, you can see that the code is not going
to be portable. If someone other than Wilma Flintstone wanted to run the
R script, they would have to alter the path to match their system.</p>

<h5 id="level-up-your-relative-paths">
<strong>Level up your relative paths</strong><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#level-up-your-relative-paths"></a>
</h5>
<p>We’ve just discussed how using relative paths is a better practice in
coding, as it helps ensure that our code works consistently across
different systems. However, relative paths can still be quite confusing
to deal with, especially when you have many sub-directories in your
project. One way to make things a bit easier on ourselves is to make
sure the part that’s <em>relative</em> to what we’re referencing is
always the same.</p>
<p>This is where using the <code>RStudio Project</code> can help. When
you create a Project in RStudio, in the background, RStudio will
automatically create a “root” folder and set it as your working
directory in R. Since in R relative paths are relative to your working
directory, this will ease referring to external input or output files
(data, images, plots, …) in a consistent manner across your project by
always having your relative paths relative to the top level folder and
help to encapsulate your work within this folder. So with an Rproject
setup, the relative path in the previous example will now be:</p>
<pre><code><span><span class="va">df</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">read.csv</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="st">"data/foodchoice_budgetlines.csv"</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>In the end, this means you can move this folder around on your
machine or to another machine, and all the paths will still be
valid.</p>

<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="treat-data-as-read-only">
<strong>Treat data as read-only</strong><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#treat-data-as-read-only"></a>
</h4>
<p>This is probably the most important goal of setting up a project.
Data is typically time-consuming and/or expensive to collect. Working
with them interactively (e.g., in Excel or R) and where they can be
modified means you are never sure of where the data came from or how it
has been modified since collection. Therefore, treating your data as
“read-only” is a good idea. However, in many cases, your data will be
“dirty”: it will need significant preprocessing to get into a format R
(or any other programming language) will find useful. Storing these
cleaning scripts in a separate folder (e.g., code) and creating a second
data folder to hold the “cleaned” data sets can prevent confusion
between the two sets. You should have separate folders for each: raw
data, code, and output data/analyses. You wouldn’t mix your clean
laundry with your dirty laundry, right?</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="treat-generated-output-as-disposable">
<strong>Treat generated output as disposable</strong><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#treat-generated-output-as-disposable"></a>
</h4>
<p>Anything generated by your scripts should be treated as disposable:
it should all be able to be regenerated from your scripts (and the raw
data). There are lots of different ways to manage this output. Having an
output folder with different sub-directories for each separate analysis
makes it easier later. Since many analyses are exploratory and aren’t
used in the final project, some of the analyses get shared between
projects.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="include-a-readme-file">
<strong>Include a README file</strong><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#include-a-readme-file"></a>
</h4>
<p>For more information about the README file and a customizable
template, check this <a href="https://perma.cc/A5PN-YF7Z" class="external-link">handout</a>.
Make sure to include citation and license information both for your data
<a href="https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/cclicenses/" class="external-link">see
creative commons license</a> and software (<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository" class="external-link">see
license types on Github</a>). This information will be critical for
others to reuse and correctly attribute your work. You may also consider
adding a separate citation and license file to your project folder.</p>
<p>Again, there are no hard and fast rules here, but remember, keeping
your raw data files separate is important to ensure they don’t get
overwritten after you use a script to clean your data. It’s also very
helpful to keep the different files generated by your analysis organized
in a folder.</p>

</h3>
<p>Having a solid backup plan in case of emergencies (say, your hard
drive on your computer fails) is essential. The general guideline for
backups is to adhere to the <a href="https://www.uschamber.com/co/run/technology/3-2-1-backup-rule" class="external-link">3-2-1
principle</a>, which dictates that you should have 3 copies on 2
different media, with 1 copy offsite. Your decision on backups will be
based on your own personal tolerance, but we recommend, at minimum,
avoiding only having a copy of your project on your personal, work
computer, or lab computer at all costs.</p>
<p>At the very least, you should back up your project in cloud storage
(either provided by your university or paid for yourself). Common cloud
storage platforms include Google Drive, Box, OneDrive, Dropbox, etc.
Backing up a project on a local device to cloud storage allows you to
meet two of the 3-2-1 criteria (2 different media and 1 offsite). If
you’re working with at least one collaborator, and they also keep an
up-to-date copy of the project on their computer, you’re set!</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="version-control-hosting-services">Version Control hosting services<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#version-control-hosting-services"></a>
</h3>
<p>If your research project involves code, the best way to make sure you
have your work backed up AND keep track of your code is to use a version
control hosting service such as GitHub. Note that out-of-the-box Git
and, thus, GitHub are not optimized to handle large files, and
therefore, we do not recommend using these tools to version data beyond
maybe small data sets in a text-based format such as CSV files.</p>
<p>The main three version control hosting services are GitHub, GitLab,
and BitBucket. To see a comparison of the available options, see this
comparison on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/demystifying-git-vs-github-atlassian-bitbucket-gitlab-pawan-verma?trk=read_related_article-card_title." class="external-link">LinkedIn</a></p>
<p>We will proceed using GitHub because it is the most used version

<p>Okay, let’s talk about implementing version control in your project
through RStudio! But first… let’s quickly clarify the difference between
Git and GitHub. We already said that GitHub is the version control
hosting platform. Git is the version control system and does not
<strong>have</strong> to be used with GitHub. You can use Git and then
host your code on Bitbucket, for example, or save it to your Google
Drive. In fact, you can use Git on your local system only and never save
it to a cloud storage platform. However, version control hosting
platforms such as GitHub enhance the benefits of version control and
offer incredible collaboration features. The difference between the two
can be a bit confusing because they are so often used together, but the
more you use them, the more it will make sense. Soon enough, you’ll be
wondering how you even completed a code project without version
control.</p>
<p>There are actually many ways to use Git; you could use it on GitHub
only (though that suffers from a lack of options and is a bit clunky),
there is a Desktop interface, and many serious programmers use it on the
command line. HOWEVER, RStudio has Git controls built in, so we’ll use
it all in one place!</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Environments are a rather advanced topic in programming, but we will
introduce some capabilities for projects in R that increase the
reproducibility of your code. Essentially, a project environment allows
us to save (or take a snapshot) of our R version and dependencies - aka
what packages/package versions are required to run our code without
error. This can be important when collaborating with others, and you may
be unsure whether you are working with the same R and package versions.
Another common issue is if you try to run very old code from a previous
project - the older the code, the more likely errors will crop up, or
the code will no longer run as it used to. To take advantage of project
environments, we will use a package called <code>renv</code>, the
successor of <code>packrat</code>, which used to be the de facto package
in R for managing environments.</p>
<p>However, as noted in this <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html" class="external-link">RStudio article
on renv</a>, using <code>renv</code> does not automatically make your
project reproducible, nor is it bullet-proof. Sometimes, other factors
come into play that may alter the results of your code despite using
<code>renv</code>, such as operating systems, compilers, etc. Many use
‘containers’ such as Docker or Kubernetes to go one step further in
assuring reproducibility. However, that is beyond the scope of this
workshop.</p>
<p>Later on this workshop we will cover dependencies and how one can
implement project environments with <code>renv</code> to increase
reproducibility with R projects.</p>
<p>Before we use Git and environments in the RStudio project, we must be
working on an R Project, so let’s talk about how R Projects work in
RStudio.</p>

<p>As mentioned earlier, one of the most powerful and useful aspects of
RStudio is its project management functionality. We’ll be using an
RStudio project today to complement our Quarto document and bundle all
the files needed for our paper into one self-contained, reproducible
bundle. An <code>.Rproj</code> file helps keep your R scripts, data, and
other files together - just navigate through your file system to get to
your project directory and double-click on the .Rproj file. The added
benefit is that the .RProj file will automatically open RStudio and
start your R session in the same directory as the <code>.Rproj</code>
file and remember exactly where you left off. The .RProj file offers a
powerful way to stay organized on their own, but it also unlocks the
additional benefit of being able to use Git within RStudio.</p>

<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="quarto-projects">Quarto Projects<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#quarto-projects"></a>
</h4>
<p>Perhaps, confusing, but we have an additional “type” of project in
the RStudio ecosystem called a Quarto project. Thankfully, we don’t
necessarily have to pick between using RStudio and Quarto projects
because a Quarto project is just an RStudio project - with some
additional capabilities. That addition is enhanced project and style
controls in the form of a YAML file called <code>_quarto.yml</code>. To
keep things simple, if you are going to use Quarto documents, use Quarto
Projects; if you aren’t, stick to an R project. And no worries, you can
always add a <code>_quarto.yml</code> file if you have just an RStudio
Project which can retroactively turn your project into a Quarto project.
We will see how to create a Quarto project further in this workshop.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Throughout this lesson, we’re going to teach you some of the
fundamentals of using Quarto as part of your RStudio workflow.</p>
<p>We’ll be using RStudio: a free, open-source R Integrated Development
Environment (IDE). It provides a built-in editor, works on all platforms
(including on servers), and provides many advantages, such as
integration with version control and project management.</p>
<p>This lesson assumes you already have a basic understanding of R and
RStudio but we will do a brief tour of the IDE, review R projects, and
the best practices for organizing your work, and how to install or check
packages you need to follow along.</p>
<p>Now, let’s open RStudio. After passing authentication, choose
<code>RStudio</code>. If you want to follow along using your local
RStudio, make sure you use IDE version RStudio v2023.06 or later and
that it is running <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/download/release.html" class="external-link">Quarto version 1.4
or above</a>. If you need to check that, for RStudio, choose
<code>Help</code> and <code>About RStudio</code>. For the Quarto version
checking, type in <code>packageVersion("quarto")</code> on the
console.</p>
<p><strong>Basic layout</strong></p>
<p>When you first open RStudio, you will be greeted by three panels:</p>
<ul>
<li>The interactive R console/Terminal (entire left)</li>
<li>Environment/History/Connections (tabbed in the upper right)</li>
<li>Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer (tabbed in the lower right)</li>
</ul>
<figure><img src="../fig/02-rstudio.PNG" alt="RStudio layout" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>Once you open files, such as .qmd, .rmd or .R files, an editor panel
will also open in the top left.</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/02-rstudio-script.PNG" alt="RStudio layout with .R file open" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><div class="section level3">
<h3 id="r-packages">R Packages<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#r-packages"></a>
</h3>
<p>Packages are the fundamental units of reproducible R code. They
include reusable R functions, the documentation that describes how to
use them, and sample data. They are collections of R functions, data,
and compiled code in a well-defined format. The directory where packages
are stored is called the library. It is possible to add functions to R
by writing a package or by obtaining a package written by someone else.
As of this writing, there are over 10,000 Packages are available on CRAN
(the comprehensive R archive network). R and RStudio have functionality
for managing packages:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can <em>install packages</em> by typing
<code>install.packages("packagename")</code>, where
<code>packagename</code> is the package name, in quotes.</li>
<li>You can <em>see what packages</em> are installed by typing
<code>installed.packages()</code>
</li>
<li>You can <em>update installed packages</em> by typing
<code>update.packages()</code>
</li>
<li>You can <em>remove a package</em> with
<code>remove.packages("packagename")</code>
</li>
<li>You can <em>make a package available</em> for use with
<code>library(packagename)</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Packages can also be viewed, loaded, and detached in the Packages tab
of the lower right panel in RStudio. Clicking on this tab will display
all of the installed packages with a checkbox next to them. If the box
next to a package name is checked, the package is loaded; if it is
empty, the package is not loaded. Click an empty box to load that
package and click a checked box to detach that package.</p>
<p>Packages can be installed and updated from the Package tab with the
<em>Install</em> and <em>Update</em> buttons at the top of the tab. We
have asked you to install a few packages prior to the workshop following
the setup instructions using the <code>install.packages()</code>
command. Let’s now make sure you have all of them good to go.</p>

<p>Remember that in the settings, we chose to use the visual editor?
RStudio released a new major update to their IDE in January 2020, which
includes a new “visual editor” to supplement their original editor
(which we will call the source editor) for authoring with markdown
syntax. The visual editor follows the WYSIWYG “what you see is what you
get” approach similar to Word or Google Docs that lets you choose
styling options from the menu (before you had to have either the
markdown code memorized or look it up for each of your styling choices).
Another major benefit is that the new editor renders the styling in
real-time so you can preview your paper before rendering it to your
output format.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="source-editor">Source Editor<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#source-editor"></a>
</h4>
<p>If you toggle the source button, you will display your quarto
document in the “source editor” mode. Notice the symbols scattered
throughout the text (#, *, &lt;&gt;). Those are examples of markdown
syntax, an easy and quick, human-readable markup language for document
styling.</p>

<p>Certain symbols are used to denote formatting that should happen to
the text (after rendering it). Before that, these symbols will show up
seemingly “randomly” throughout the text and don’t contribute to the
narrative in a logical way. In the template qmd document, there are
three types of such symbols (<code>##, **, &lt;&gt;</code>). Each symbol
represents different formatting (think of the text formatting buttons
you use in Word). Can you deduce how these symbols format the

<p>Let’s switch back to the visual editor. You’ll notice that formatting
elements like headings, hyperlinks, and bold have been generated
automatically, giving us a preview of how our text will render. However,
the visual editor does not run any code automatically. We’ll have to do
that manually (but we will learn how to do that later on).</p>
<p>We will proceed using the visual editor during this workshop as it is
more user-friendly and allows us to talk about styling without needing
to teach the whole markdown syntax system. However, we highly encourage
you to become familiar with markdown syntax as it increases your ability
to format and style your paper without relying on the visual editor
options.</p>
<p>Note that both the visual and the source editors offer the option to
display an outline of your document <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63265343/192625580-ad6bddc1-98b7-437e-8aaf-2190651d456b.png" alt="image" class="figure"> which make it easier to navigate long documents.</p>

<p>RStudio projects make it straightforward to divide your work into
multiple contexts, each with its own working directory, workspace,
history, and source documents. There are several options for working
with RStudio projects and enabling version control:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<strong>New Directory</strong> - start a brand new RStudio project
(with the option of version control).</li>
<li>
<strong>Existing Directory</strong> - add existing work to a project
in RStudio (with the option of setting up version control).</li>
<li>
<strong>Version Control</strong> Continue an existing RStudio
project that already uses version control (i.e., download it from
GitHub).</li>
</ol>
<figure><img src="../fig/05-new-project.PNG" class="image-with-shadow figure mx-auto d-block" alt="new r project options"></figure><p>When initiating a new project with a new directory, you are presented
with a variety of project options, including a generic “New Project”
(aka R Project) and a “Quarto project”, as seen in the image below.
Regardless of your choice at this step, you can create new Quarto
documents within R projects, Quarto projects, or even outside projects
at any time. You may also convert an R project to a Quarto project and
back at any point as well.</p>
<p>However, there’s no need to worry too much about this now because we
will be working on an existing project using version control. So let’s
focus on the basics first, and we’ll explore more advanced features of
Quarto projects in a later episode.</p>

<p>Using version control is a powerful feature to make your research
more reproducible and better organized. In order to use versioning while
working in RStudio make sure your work is set up as an R Project.
RStudio’s versioning features don’t work unless your work is part of an
R Project. There are three options for starting an R Project, depending
on your given scenario.</p>
<p><em>Of course if an existing RStudio project is already under version
control, then opening the project will be the only thing you need to
do!</em></p>
<p>Let’s see how this setup would work.</p>

git repository</em>” box as highlighted in this screenshot: <img src="../fig/05-brand-new-project.PNG" class="image-with-shadow figure" alt="new project w/ version control"></p>
<p>*Note when you choose directory name, it will create a new directory
in the directory you specified along with an .Rproj file of the same
name. Avoid spaces here. underscores “_”, dashes “-” or camel case
“NewProject” is the recommended way to name this directory/file.</p>
<p>*Optionally, check the box in the bottom left corner, “Open in new
session,” if you want it to appear in a new RStudio window.</p>

started a Quarto project WITHOUT version control, you have the option to
add version control retrospectively. You can also add existing R files
to a project and set up version control if you’ve done neither. To see a
tutorial of this process, please see <a href="https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/14-supplemental-rstudio.html" class="external-link">episode
14 “Using Git from RStudio” in Version Control with Git</a>.</p>
<p>This is by far the most labor-intensive way to do it, so remember to
add version control at the beginning of any new project.</p>

<p>We have a repository already prepared for this workshop at <a href="https://github.com/UCSBCarpentry/Quarto-Project-Example" class="external-link uri">https://github.com/UCSBCarpentry/Quarto-Project-Example</a>.
We are going to use the third option to download this repository from
GitHub and work with it hands-on. You will need this repo in your
working environment if you would like to follow along through this
workshop. Let’s take a second to acquaint ourselves with GitHub. <a href="https://github.com/signup" class="external-link">At this link</a>, you may sign into
your GitHub account or create one if you have not already.</p>

should contain a narrative description of the project.</p>
<p>We are each going to make a copy of this repository to use for this
workshop. To do so, we will do what’s called “forking” on GitHub. A Fork
is a copy of a repository that you get to experiment with without
disrupting the original project.</p>
<p>On Github, in the upper right-hand corner of the repository, click on
the button that says “Fork” - see highlighted example below:</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/05-fork.PNG" class="image-with-shadow figure mx-auto d-block" alt="fork on GitHub"></figure><p>If you are a member of any organizations on GitHub, you will be asked
whether you want to fork to your account or to an organization. Choose
your personal account for this workshop. GitHub will process it for a
few moments, and voila! You have your own copy of the workshop example
repository.</p>
<p>Now, click on the green <code>Code</code> drop-down and then click on
the copy icon next to the repository URL:</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/05-copy-repo.PNG" class="image-with-shadow figure mx-auto d-block" alt="copy GitHub repository url"></figure><p>Now, let’s return to RStudio and make our new project.</p>
<p>Click
<code>File &gt; New Project &gt; Version Control &gt; Git</code>.</p>
<p>Paste in your repository’s Github URL and click the “Create Project”
button.</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/05-git-new-project-clone.png" class="image-with-shadow figure mx-auto d-block" alt="start my R project"></figure><p>Now, you have cloned a copy of your git repo from Github to your
working environment.</p>
<p>If you’re working in the JupyterHub environment or have not yet used
Git on your machine, you will need to configure your Git identity with
your name and email before you’ll be able to commit the changes you make
during this workshop. Substitute your name and email address in the
commands below and paste them into the Terminal panel of RStudio.</p>
<pre><code>git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
git config --global user.name "Your Name"</code></pre>
<p>Woo hoo! We have the project we’re working on for this workshop
opened in RStudio and set to use version control!</p>

<p>First, make sure “Enable version control interface for RStudio
projects” is checked. Next, you must make sure that the Git executable
path is correct. For Macs, more than likely, the path will be
automatically populated as: <code>/usr/bin/git</code>. You may need to
change it to:
<code>/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/git</code></p>
<p>Windows users may find that the correct path is also pre-populated,
or you may need to manually add it by clicking “browse”. Your path will
be something like <code>C:/Program Files/Git/bin/git.exe</code>. If not,
search for where Git for Windows was installed, go into the bin folder,
and select the <code>git.exe</code> file.</p>
<p>Ok! Now we have that set up. By the way, this is a one-time set up.
From now on, RStudio should know where to find git on your device. We
should be able to open our project from GitHub in RStudio.</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="git-workflow">Git Workflow<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#git-workflow"></a>
</h3>
<p>The most simple workflow for version control (working on your
computer only) is referred to as “add” and “commit”:</p>
<p>But what do those words even mean?</p>
<p><strong>Add:</strong> Choose a file or files to take a “snapshot” of.
What files do you want to add to your next version?</p>
<p><strong>Commit:</strong> Take a “snapshot” of a selected version of
your project. The snapshot will <em>only</em> include the files you
“added”, typically only files that you’ve edited since your last
commit.</p>
<p>You may have just a few commits in a single work session or many
commits.</p>
<p>When you commit, you add a “commit message,” a.k .a. a short line of
text (recommended 50 characters or less) that describes the changes that
were made to the file(s) you added. This helps keep your versions
organized and makes it easier to remember what you did or restore your
work to exactly the version needed if you make a mistake or want to
implement a change.</p>

</h4>
<p>If we are saving our work to a version control hosting cloud platform
such as GitHub, our workflow gets a bit more complex, we add a “pull”
and “push” step at the beginning and end of a work session.</p>
<p><code>Pull &gt; add &gt; commit &gt; push</code></p>
<p><strong>Pull:</strong> <em>download</em> the most recent version of
the repository <em>from</em> GitHub <em>to</em> your local computer.</p>
<p><strong>Push:</strong> <em>upload</em> the most recent version of the
repository <em>to</em> GitHub <em>from</em> your local computer.</p>
<p>Put a pin in pulling and pushing for now. For the time being, as we
edit our paper, we will just stick to adding and committing. In the end,
we’ll see how to use push to GitHub, and you can experiment with pulling
later on.</p>

<li>Commit frequently; each commit should be a distinct set of edits

<p>As seen, reproducibility implies sharing data, code, and workflows to
produce the analysis and compute results. While writing scientific
reports, one may choose RStudio IDE to marry all these pieces together
and take advantage of the various tools it integrates with. Having a
publication while minimizing reproducibility friction can be
accomplished with Quarto. <a href="https://quarto.org/" class="external-link">Quarto</a> is a
multi-language, next-generation version of R Markdown from Posit. It
includes new features and capabilities while being able to render most
existing Rmd files without any modification. With Quarto, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create dynamic content with Rstudio/R, Python, Julia, and
Observable.</li>
<li>Author documents as plain text markdown or Jupyter notebooks.</li>
<li>Publish high-quality articles, reports, presentations, websites,
blogs, and books in HTML, PDF, MS Word, ePub, and more.</li>
<li>Author with scientific markdown, including equations, citations,
crossrefs, figure panels, callouts, advanced layout, and more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Quarto generates a .qmd file that weaves together content and
executable code into an elegantly formatted output, which can be
published in various formats. It is a convenient tool for reproducible
and dynamic reports which will help you:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Keep an eye on the text (the paper) AND the source code. These
computational steps are essential to ensure computational
reproducibility.</li>
<li>Conduct the entire analysis pipeline in a Quarto document: data
(pre-)processing, analysis, outputs, and visualization.</li>
<li>Apply a formatting syntax that is part of the R ecosystem and
supports LaTeX.</li>
<li>Combine markdown text and source code in R (and other
languages).</li>
<li>Easily share documents with colleagues as supplemental material or
as the paper under review.</li>
<li>Get figures automatically updated if you change the underlying
parameters in the code. The error-prone task of exporting figures and
uploading the right figure version to another platform is thus not
needed anymore.</li>
<li>Since it uses a text-based format, you can also use versioning
control with Git.</li>
<li>If you do not make any changes to the document after creating the
output document, you can be sure that the paper is executable, at least
at the time of submission.</li>
<li>Refer to the corresponding code lines in the methodology section,
making it unnecessary to use pseudocode, high-level textual
descriptions, or just too many words to describe the computational
analysis.</li>
</ol>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Finally, three real-world examples that motivated the authors of this
lesson to value and use Quarto:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>You can <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/books/" class="external-link">publish
books</a> using GitHub Pages, Netlify, RStudio Connect, or any other
static hosting service or intranet web server.</p></li>
<li><p>Imagine you want to create a short document that includes some
math formulas. The LaTeX document preparation can be used for this, but
it can be difficult and overkill for just a few formulas in otherwise
plain text. As we will learn, through Pandoc, Quarto lets you use just
the best part of LaTeX—math formatting—while letting you write your text
in a user-friendly way. The editor will automatically recognize the
syntax and treat the equation as math.</p></li>
<li><p>In a past version of this workshop, we struggled with a
scientific paper published in a reputable journal. In trying to recreate
the original authors’ plots, we found it difficult and time-consuming to
figure out exactly how the authors created their plots. Out of the many
columns in their data, many have similar-sounding names. Which did they
use? How did they handle missing data? Exactly what operations did they
perform to compute aggregate values? How much easier it would have been
if they had published the code they used along with their paper. RStudio
and Quarto allow you to do this.</p></li>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>The key to our reproducible workflow is using Quarto files in RStudio
rather than basic scripts to dynamically render both code and paper
narrative. So let’s do a quick anatomy lesson on the components of a
Quarto file (YAML header, Quarto formatted, R code blocks; also known as
“code chunks”) and how to render them into our final formatted document.
There are four distinct steps in the Quarto workflow:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>create a <strong>YAML header</strong> (optional)</li>
<li>write Quarto-formatted <strong>text</strong>
</li>
<li>add R <strong>code blocks</strong> for embedded analysis</li>
<li>render the document with the selected engine <strong>(Knitr in this
example)</strong>
</li>
</ol>
<figure><img src="../fig/03-qmd-workflow.png" alt="Quarto Workflow" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>Let’s dig into those more:</p>

<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="what-is-yaml-anyway">What is YAML anyway?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-is-yaml-anyway"></a>
</h4>
<p>YAML, pronounced “Yeah-mul” stands for “YAML Ain’t Markup Language”.
YAML is a human-readable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization" class="external-link">data-serialization</a>
language which, as its name suggests, is not a markup language. YAML has
no executable commands, though it is compatible with all programming
languages and virtually any application that stores or transmits data.
YAML itself is made up of bits of many languages, including Perl, MIME,
C, &amp; HTML. YAML is also a superset of JSON. When used as a
stand-alone file, the file ending is .yml or .yaml. <br></p>
<p>Quarto default YAML header includes the following metadata surrounded
by three dashes <code>---</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>title</li>
<li>author</li>
<li>format</li>
<li>editor</li>
</ul>
<figure><img src="../fig/03-qmd-template-yaml.png" alt="yaml highlighted in document" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>You can select the output format using the wizard when creating a new
document. This allows you to render the .qmd file in your preferred
format. By default, options include PDF, HTML, and Word, but a wide

output formats options</a> is also available and can be configured based
on your project needs. <br></p>
<p>We’ll see other formatting options for YAML later on, including
adding bibliography information, customizing our output, and changing
the default settings for executing your code. Below is an example of how
our YAML file will look at the end of this workshop.</p>

<p>This one is simple, it’s literally just text narrative formatted by
using markdown (more on markdown syntax later). Markdown-formatted text
is one of the benefits added above and beyond the capabilities of a
regular r script. Any text section will have the default white
background in the qmd document. As you might know, in a regular R file,
# starts a comment. In Quarto, plain text is just plain narrative text
that appears in the document. In R scripts, plain text wants to be code.
In Quarto, you will need to enclose your code in special characters. Any
symbols you do see that aren’t regular grammar components are for
formatting, such as <code>##</code>, <code>** **</code>, and
<code>&lt; &gt;</code>.</p>

the curly brackets <code>{}</code>indicate how R should read and display
the code (more on this in the Knitr syntax episodes). These are the
sections where you add R code, such as summary statistics, analysis,
tables, and plots. If you’ve already written an R script, you can copy

<h3 class="callout-title">A note about coding approaches in
RStudio:</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>When writing code in Rstudio, there are different workflows you can
use, including writing code directly in the console, using a separate R
script, or writing your code in a .qmd file. The best approach depends
on your specific needs and preferences:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Writing code directly in the console</em> is useful when you
want to execute code immediately to see the effect of a statement making
a quick change or calculation. However, keeping track of your written
code can be challenging, especially if it takes multiple lines.
Additionally, if you need to run the same code multiple times, you’ll
have to rewrite it each time, which can be inconvenient if you plan to
reuse it.</li>
<li>
<em>Using a separate R script</em> is a more organized way to write
and save code, and you can easily reuse it later or share it with
others. You can easily edit and rerun the script if you need to modify
the code. However, running code in a script requires more steps than
running code in the console, and it can be more challenging to modify
code interactively.</li>
<li>
<em>Using a .qmd file</em> combines the advantages of both the
console and R script. A .qmd file allows you to write. R code and text
in the same document make organizing and documenting your work easier.
Additionally, you can run the code directly in the paper, which makes it
easier to modify and rerun code interactively.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will use the third approach for most of this workshop since we
focus on creating a reproducible paper.</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="rendering-your-qmd-document">4. Rendering your Qmd document:<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#rendering-your-qmd-document"></a>
</h3>
<p>Simply put, rendering is the process of converting a document into a
file format or a medium that is paginated or has the concept of pages.
Clicking the render button will compile the code, check for errors, and
output the type of file indicated in your yaml header. You may select
the option “Render on Save” to see a preview of your document every time
you save edits. Attention: your qmd document may not run and render as
your indicated output if there are any errors in the document, so it
also functions somewhat as a code checker. <br></p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="try-it-yourself">Try it yourself!<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#try-it-yourself"></a>
</h4>
<p>We’re going to pause here and see what the Quarto document does when
it’s rendered. We’ll just use the generic template, but when we’re
working on our own project, rendering periodically while we’re editing
allows us to catch any mistakes early. We’ll continue rendering our qmd
throughout the lesson to see what happens when we add our markdown and
knitr syntax and to make sure we aren’t making any errors.</p>
<p>This is a little preview of what’s to come in the later episodes:
Click the “render” button.</p>
<p>Before you can render your document, you’ll need to give it a file
name and choose what folder you want to save it to. Choose
<code>my_first_qmd.qmd</code> as your file name and save it to an easily
accessible directory in your file system.</p>
<p>Your document should render like this: <br></p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>As we mentioned earlier, the visual editor in RStudio makes
formatting much more effortless. It provides improved productivity for
composing longer-form articles and analyses with Quarto. Markdown
documents can be edited in either source or visual mode. To switch into
visual mode for a given document, toggle on the visual option at the
top-left of the document toolbar (alternatively for windows, the ⌘⇧ F4
keyboard shortcut). This will prompt a formatting bar through which you
can apply styling, add links, create tables, and others similar to
functions you find in google docs and other document editors. Note that
you can switch between source and visual mode at any time (editing
location and undo/redo state will be preserved when you switch). Let’s
try it! Feel free to follow along or just watch this quick demo. But
first, make sure to have your visual editor enabled on your screen.
Also, make sure to open your
<code>DataPaper-ReproducibilityWorkshop.qmd</code> file located at the
<code>report</code> folder.</p>

<em>Applying Emphasis</em><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#applying-emphasis"></a>

<p>At the very top of the document we have a recommended citation for
the sample data paper (<strong>Example 1</strong>). We want to emphasize
the title of the journal, “Data in brief” in italics. Select the text
and click in the I icon and voilà! Remember to delete (Example 1).</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="adding-links">
<em>Adding Links</em><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#adding-links"></a>
</h3>
<p>In the same citation we have just worked on, let’s now add a link to
it by selecting and copying the doi address (<strong>Example
2</strong>). Then, click on the link icon and paste the address in the
URL field. Simple right? If you prefer, you can also the drop-down
insert menu, or even use shortcuts. By hovering the mouse over the
desired icon, you will see which keys you should use, also found in this
<a href="https://rstudio.github.io/visual-markdown-editing/shortcuts.html" class="external-link">markdown
shortcuts list</a>. To revert a shortcut, use the backspace key.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="adding-headings">
<em>Adding Headings</em><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#adding-headings"></a>
</h3>
<p>Adding headings to a a Quarto markdown document in Rstudio is as
simple as applying links. Let’s say we want the abstract section as a
Heading Level 2. We can select the “abstract” then, and under “Normal”
on the left-hand side of the menu, we can choose the desired level.
Again, all the shortcuts will be listed next to the styling in the menu.
Now apply the same heading to keywords and Level 2 to “Value of the
Data” (<strong>Example 3</strong>).</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="creating-tables">
<em>Creating Tables</em><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#creating-tables"></a>
</h3>
<p>Because creating tables manually in qmd documents could be a little
painful for beginners, Rstudio released an add-in functionality for
tables back in 2018. The new visual editor, however, have made the
process to create qmd tables more similar to other editors we use daily.
In our template, we have the specification table with 10 rows and two
columns. If we were willing to add that table, we could do that by
inserting a table to a selected part of the documents and by specifying
the desired number of rows and columns. Including a caption is optional,
but recommended. We can add or delete rows and columns, add a header
that will be set bold by default but can be changed, and set the desired
alignment. Select the desired text and click on the crossed T icon if
you wish to clear formatting.</p>

<h3 id="creating-bullet-and-numbered-lists">
<em>Creating Bullet and Numbered Lists</em><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#creating-bullet-and-numbered-lists"></a>
</h3>
<p>Again, similarly to other document editors, Rstudio allows you to
turn text into bullet or numbered lists. Let’s apply a bullet list to
the paragraphs specifying the “Values of the Data” reported in the data
paper (<strong>Example 4</strong>). Assuming we were willing to create a
numbered list instead, we could have followed the same process and
chosen the other icon. We can also sink or lift the listed items.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="adding-images">
<em>Adding Images</em><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#adding-images"></a>
</h3>
<p>You may need to include static images to your manuscripts. For that,
you can use the insert image function, click on the painting icon or
even use the shortcut that shows right next to the function in the menu.
After browsing and upload the desired image you may also specify the
caption and the image title, as well as adjust dimensions if needed.
Let’s insert image for Fig. 1 (<strong>Example 5</strong>).</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="adding-formulas">
<em>Adding Formulas</em><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#adding-formulas"></a>
</h3>
<p>If you have math formula in your manuscript there are three different
ways you may insert one. Let’s look for (<strong>Example 6</strong>) for
an example. Point and click at the insert menu, use the catch-all
<code>⌘ /</code> keyboard short and then get to inline math mode, or
type the formula content between dollar signs <code>$</code>. You will
notice that the color and font type will change, as Rstudio identifies
the block as an inline equation.</p>
</div>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="keyboard-shortcuts">Keyboard Shortcuts<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#keyboard-shortcuts"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>As you become a more regular Rstudio user, you may also consider
using some keyboard shortcuts for all basic editing tasks. Visual mode
supports both traditional keyboard shortcuts (e.g. <code>⌘ B</code> for
bold) as well as markdown shortcuts (using markdown syntax directly).
For example, enclose <strong>bold</strong> text in asterisks or type ##
and press space to create a second level heading. Here are some of the
most commonly used shortcuts for Mac users:</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/06-shortcuts.png" alt="Fig. 6.3 - Shortcuts" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>Tip: Windows users should replace in the shortcuts above
<code>⌘</code> by <code>ctrl</code> and <code>⌥⌘</code> by
<code>alt (+) ctrl</code>.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>The visual editor allows users to insert images by browsing their
location or copying and pasting it to the Qmd document directly. There
are also options to add html, line blocks, blockquotes, and footnotes.
Up next we will learn more about how to add code chunks. In further
episodes we will also learn how to insert citations and create a
bibliography.</p>

Only)<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#bonus-content-more-styling-with-fence-divs-demonstration-only"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Quarto also allows some cool styling using colons to create
<em>fenced divs</em>. The advantage of using fenced divs is that you may
section styling/layout to pieces of your content more easily, using an
unified and syntax, while also protecting and preserving formatting
across different types of outputs. Essentially, these will adopt the
following structure:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start and end with an equal number of colons being minimum of 3
<code>:::</code>
</li>
<li>Add curly brackets to indicate the start/end of a class or name,
e.g., <code>{.class}</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We won’t have time to cover these extensively, but let’s take a look
at a few examples.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="adding-borders-around-text">
<em>Adding borders around text</em><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#adding-borders-around-text"></a>

using a div:</p>
<p>If we type: <br></p>
<pre><code>
::: {.border}

<h3 id="dividing-content-into-separate-columns">
<em>Dividing content into separate columns</em><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#dividing-content-into-separate-columns"></a>
</h3>
<p>If we want to separate content into two or more columns that could be
accomplished with a similar approach as above.</p>
<p>If we type: <br></p>
<pre><code>
:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
Some content in left column
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
Some Content in right column
:::

<hr class="half-width">
<p>We’ve learned about the text-formatting options for Quarto in
RStudio. Now, let’s dive into the code portion of Quarto documents. As
we’ve seen so far, Quarto flips the “code first” default of R scripts,
prioritizing code over text. Instead of using comments to add text,
Quarto Documents uses a “text-first” default and requires the use of
special syntax to add code. In Quarto documents, the syntax to signal
the switch to code is called “code chunks” in RStudio (referred to as
“code cells” in other environments). Code chunks are interpreted by
Knitr. But first, what is Knitr?</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="what-is-knitr">What is Knitr?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-is-knitr"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Knitr is the engine in RStudio, which creates the “dynamic” part of
Quarto reports. More specifically, it’s a package that allows the
integration of R code into the HTML, word, PDF, or LaTeX document you
have specified as your output for Quarto. It utilizes Literate
Programming to make research more reproducible.</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="how-it-works">How it works?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#how-it-works"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>First, code chunks are sent to a preceding stage of processing by
Knitr, which runs the code, generates any plots or figures, and then
“knits” the code output and text together. Next, Quarto outputs the
“knitted” text and renders code into an HTML document (or another
document type indicated in your configuration file).</p>
<p>There are two ways to add code to Quarto documents:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Code Chunks</li>
<li>Inline Code (as we will see in the next episode)</li>
</ol>
<p>First, we’re going to talk about code chunks for including
substantial portions of code into our narrative, such as generating
figures and plots. A plethora of options become available to us when
using code chunks, so this tends to be the more complex part of Quarto
documents.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Code chunks (also called “code blocks” or “code cells”) are the
preferred option when you need to write more than a line or two of code,
such as building plots or tables. More than just a vehicle to run code,
they also allow modifications to how code is rendered and styled in your
final output. We’ll learn more about that as we walk through the
“anatomy” of a code chunk.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="creating-a-code-chunk">Creating a Code Chunk<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#creating-a-code-chunk"></a>
</h3>
<p>Okay, let’s get to some code! Some plots have already been included
in our paper but as static images. Now, we will add some additional
plots generated straight from R code - which are also more reproducible
and easier to update than static images. Using code to generate images
directly assures us that if there are any changes to the data or code
the plots will update automatically. We also don’t have to generate the
new plots, save them as images, and then add them back into our paper.
Not only is this a time-saver, but it also helps prevent versioning
errors!</p>
<p>Navigate to the end of the paper where it says <strong>“Example
8”</strong>. This is where we will add our first code chunk.</p>
<p>Let’s start a new code chunk by typing our starting backticks &amp; r
between curly brackets or using the buttons in the editor toolbar.</p>

image, the only <strong>required</strong> syntax for a code chunk are
the backticks preceding and ending (seen only in source mode) and the
specified language (in our case, ‘r’) placed between the curly
brackets.</p>

<p>Although we will (mostly) be using R in this workshop, it’s possible
to use other programming or markup languages. For example, we have seen
that we can use LaTeX code for equations. You can also use Python and a
handful of other languages, so if R is not your preferred programming
but you like working in the RStudio environment, don’t despair! Other
options include SQL, Julia, bash, c, etc. It should be noted, however,
that some languages (like Python) will require installing and loading
additional packages.</p>

Unfortunately, a slight discrepancy exists between the behavior of
regular R scripts run in R projects and Quarto projects. R scripts will
always use the project’s root folder as the working directory, while
Quarto documents use the folder where the qmd file is located as the
working directory. If you were learning on your own, you may have been
majorly confused by this minute difference. No worries, we’ll see how to
change the default working directory globally in the next episode.</p>

<p>In the previous episode, we just saw how to run our code in our code
chunks to test that it works and to see a preview of the code output
that will render in our HTML document, but to <em>actually</em> render
the final, we need to use the Render button as with. Using the
<code>Render</code> button with code chunks is a two-step process -
first, the code is run (all code chunks will run automatically). Second,

<p>There are over 50 different code chunk options!!! Obviously, we will
not go over all of them, but they fall into several larger categories,
including code evaluation, text output, code style, cache options, plot
output, and animation. We’ll discuss a few options for code evaluation,
text output, and plot output.</p>
<p>Code chunk options in Quarto are added within code chunks and always
have the following format:</p>
<p><code>#| option: option-text</code></p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="common-code-chunk-options">Common code chunk options:<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#common-code-chunk-options"></a>
</h3>
<p><strong>include</strong> = (logical) whether to include the chunk
output in the output document (defaults to TRUE).<br><strong>eval</strong> = (logical or numeric) TRUE/FALSE to evaluate (or
not) or a numeric value like c(1,3) (only evaluate expressions 1 and
3).<br><strong>echo</strong> = (logical or numeric - following the same rules
as above) whether to display source code or not.<br><strong>results</strong> = (logical or character) text output of the
code can be hidden (hide or FALSE) or delineated in a certain way
(default ‘markup’).<br><strong>warning</strong> = (logical) whether to display the warnings in
the output (default TRUE). FALSE will output warnings to the console
only.<br><strong>message</strong> = (logical) whether or not to display messages
that appear when running the code (default TRUE).</p>

<p>Ok, let’s use some of the options above to improve the look of our
Quarto document. Add the following options one by one to see how they
change your output (click <code>Render</code> after each option you
add):</p>
<ul>
<li>echo: false</li>
<li>message: false</li>
<li>warning: false</li>
<li>results: false</li>
</ul>
<p>These options mean the source code will not be printed in the
rendered HTML document, messages from the code will not be printed in
the rendered HTML document, and warnings will not be printed in the HTML
document (but will still output to the console). Plots, figures, or
whatever is printed by the code WILL show up in the final html
document.</p>
<p>Now, we are seeing what we would like: a figure without other output
to show in our paper.</p>

</h3>
<p>Before we get to fixing how our code output looks, let’s pause a
second and give our code chunk a label. While not required for running
your code, it is good practice to give a name to each code chunk because
a label is a unique identifier that allows for more advanced options
(such as cross-referencing) to work with your qmd files later on:</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/07-code-label.png" alt="code chunk label" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>Some things to keep in mind</p>
<ul>
<li>The chunk label syntax is always <code>#| label: chunk-label</code>
with <code>chunk-label</code> replaced with your own text</li>
<li>The chunk label has to be unique (i.e., you can’t use the same name
for multiple chunks)</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ll see in a bit where this code chunk label comes in handy. But,
for now, let’s go back and give our first code chunk a name:</p>
<p><code>#| label: fig-heartrate</code></p>
<p>When naming your code chunks that will produce figures or tables, use
<code>fig-</code> and <code>tbl-</code>. We will learn how these will
allow for cross-references.</p>

<div class="callout-content">
<p>Avoid spaces, periods <code>(.)</code>, and underscores

are recommended to use hyphens <code>(-)</code> instead. For example,
setup-options is a good label, whereas setup.options and chunk 1 are
bad; fig-path = ‘figures/mcmc-’ is a good path for figure output, and
fig-path = ‘markov chain/monte carlo’ is bad. See more at: <a href="https://yihui.org/knitr/options/" class="external-link uri">https://yihui.org/knitr/options/</a></p>

<p>The options we just looked at focus on code evaluation and text
output. However, we have another set of options that deal with how plot
or figure outputs look at act. Many of the options start with
<code>fig</code>. The one we will use today allows us to add a caption
to our figure. Again, this is an optional feature, but if you need (or
want) to add captions to your publication, it is straightforward to do
in code chunks.</p>
<p>The caption information also resides at the top of a code chunk using
the <code>#|</code> syntax as such:</p>
<p><code>#| fig-cap: "Figure Caption Here"</code></p>
<p><strong>Don’t forget to put the caption within quotes
<code>""</code>.</strong></p>

<h3 id="best-practices-for-loading-data-and-packages">Best Practices for Loading Data and Packages<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#best-practices-for-loading-data-and-packages"></a>
</h3>
<p>We can improve organization and rendering speed in our documents by
learning how to load data and packages. So far, we’ve loaded the library
<code>tidyverse</code> and the data frame <code>df</code> we need in the
first code chunk. Now, if we want to add another figure (say the hormone
analysis code ’hormone_analysis.R`), which uses the same data as our
first code generated figure - we would be loading tidyverse and the data
for a second time. This is unnecessary because once libraries and data
are loaded in a Quarto document, they are available for use in the rest
of the code in the following document.</p>
<p>The best practice is to load libraries and data once at the beginning
of our document, making it available for all other figures or
calculations throughout the document - allowing us to avoid repetition
in our code and saving us rendering time. This also makes it easier for
us to keep track of all the libraries and data we need to use in any
given document for ourselves and collaborators. If anything needs to be
tweaked, we don’t need to search through every code chunk in our qmd
document to make a change - it’s listed right at the top.</p>

<p>At this point, we could go back through our R scripts and comment out

time taking this step would save. Bonus: This also works to load the
data before it is called in the inline code as we will see below.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>We have already learned how to create, run, and customize code
chunks, but what if you only need to make a quick calculation, and
adding a code chunk seems a little overkill?</p>
<p>Sometimes, you just need to do a quick calculation to add to your
narrative - such as a count of total observations in your data or the
mean of one of your variables. In those cases, it may not be worth
setting up a code chunk to calculate those values, so Quarto also
provides the ability to use inline code.</p>
<p>If that is the case, you can include <code>r code</code> directly in
the text portion of your document by enclosing it between single
backticks. Say you are discussing some of the summary statistics in your
manuscript, Quarto makes this possible through HTML/LaTeX inline code,
which allows you to calculate simple expressions integrated into your
narrative. Inline code lets you insert `r code`\ into your document to
dynamically update portions of your text. In other words, if your data
set changes, the code will automatically update the specified
calculation.</p>
<p>This can be helpful when referring to specific variables in your
data. For example, you should include numbers that are derived from the
data as code, not as numbers.</p>
<p>Thus, rather than writing “The CSV file contains choice consistency
data for 10.000 simulated participants” <strong>(Example 7A)</strong>,
replace the static number with a bit of code that, when evaluated, gives
you a dynamic number if anything changes on your dataset. Note that
there is not an insert option to do this from the menu in the visual
editor, so we need to insert inline code manually, for example:</p>
<p>The CSV file contains choice consistency data for `r
nrow(bronars_simulation_data)`\ simulated participants.</p>
<p>When you render, you might get an error. Any idea why? That is
because we need to make sure to import the dataset we are referring to
before the inline code can work. Let’s add the following to our chunk at
the beginning of the document where we loaded our other data:</p>

<p>You may remember (or not, that’s ok!) that when we saw how to create
a new Project back in episode 4 we were presented with this long list of
project options:</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/07-project-options.png" class="image-with-shadow figure mx-auto d-block" alt="Project Options"></figure><p>We told you not to worry too much as most of these options are just
variations of a regular old R Project (including a Quarto Project!)
Regardless of your choice at this step, you can create new Quarto
documents within R projects, Quarto projects, or even outside projects
at any time. You may also convert an R project to a Quarto project and
back at any point as well.</p>
<p>You may, therefore, be a bit confused about the distinction between a
Quarto Project and a regular R Project. To put it simply, a Quarto
project is an R Project which contains a “_quarto.yml” file. This file
dictates shared YAML configuration across documents in a Quarto project.
This ensures that any document rendered within the project directory
automatically inherits the metadata defined at the project level
allowing capabilities such as defining a style for the whole project or
redirecting outputs to a specified sub-directory. The Quarto Website,
Blog and Book are simply Quarto Projects with a pre-defined
“_quarto.yml” file defining some basic style settings characteristic of
those mediums (and even then a Quarto Blog could be easily converted to
a Quarto Website for example).</p>

is wherever the qmd document is located, but our code is located in a
different folder. This means they have different relative paths to
locate and read the data we want to work with. We can simplify things by
designating the working directory for our document relative to the root
project directory instead. This lets all files work relative to the
project root instead of each other, standardizing the relative paths.
Note that this is mainly important for code chunks - text portions of
Quarto documents are not affected. This will clarify some of our
confusion with relative paths across our R project.</p>
<p>So, one should learn how to accomplish that by changing the working
directory at the project level YAML settings. So we’ll navigate to our
_quarto.yml document in our root project directory and open it.</p>
<p>We’ll add the following settings to the yml file:</p>
<pre><code><span><span class="va">...</span></span>
<span>  <span class="va">execute</span><span class="op">-</span><span class="va">dir</span><span class="op">:</span> <span class="va">project</span></span>
<span><span class="va">...</span></span></code></pre>
<p>So the yml file should now look something like this:</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Let’s learn another technique for adding code-generated plots and
figures to our document. This time around, let’s see how to run code in
a code chunk from an external R script instead of somewhat awkwardly
copying and pasting the code from an R script to a code chunk in our
<code>.qmd</code>.</p>
<p>There are at least a few benefits to running code in this modular
fashion instead of copy/pasting:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Automatic updates: if the code gets updated in the R script, it
will automatically be updated in the Quarto document as well. We won’t
need to copy/paste code updates, which would make it easy to end up with
discrepancies between our <code>.r</code> scripts and our
<code>.qmd</code> paper.</p></li>
<li><p>Readability: calling code externally only takes several lines of
code - versus copy/pasting 50+ lines of code from our scripts.</p></li>
<li><p>Less fussing with relative paths* - we had to change the code
slightly in the first example to update the file path to the data set,
which introduces variations and inconsistencies. With this method, we
won’t have to modify the source code.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>*unfortunately, you will never be free of relative paths, but you can
make it a bit easier on yourself.</p>
<p>Again, let’s test this out in our generic Quarto document. After our
first figure, add a new code chunk:</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/08-blank-code-chunk.png" alt="basic code chunk" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>We’re just going to test out the same figure again so we can verify
this new method works.</p>

<p>Correctly citing and attributing publications is key to academic
writing. Older versions of RStudio require <a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#citation-syntax" class="external-link">Pandoc’s citation
syntax</a> to render bibliographies correctly. We won’t be covering this
approach extensively in this workshop since the new visual editor has
made this process much simpler. You can refer to our <a href="https://ucsbcarpentry.github.io/R-markdown/06-citations-bib/index.html" class="external-link">previous
workshop on R Markdown</a> pre-visual editor for more information.</p>
<p>The new visual editor has made citations and cross-referencing much
easier, by offering different options for referencing various types of
sources. Before getting into these different features, let’s first learn
how you can call the citation window dialog on Rstudio and how to
navigate these different options.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>After placing your cursor where you want to insert the citation, you
can either click the <code>@</code> icon in the toolbar or select
<code>Insert</code>, and from the drop-down menu, choose
<code>Citation</code>. Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut
<kbd>⇧⌘ F8</kbd> on Mac or <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+F8</kbd> for Windows.</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/09-insert-citation.png" alt="Citation Window" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>The citation window will display different options for inserting
citations. You can either find items listed in your own sources through
your Bibliography folder (you should have one already in your project
folder provided by us), your Zotero Library(ies) if you have the
reference manager installed on your computer, or even use the lookup
feature to search for publications by DOI (Digital Object Identifier),
Crossref, DataCite, or PubMed ID as we will explore a bit more
shortly.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Have you noticed that the YAML header contains “bibliography:
references.bib”. Any idea why? Well, that’s because on our paper
template, we have some existing citations and a
<code>references.bib</code> file in our project folder. Rstudio
automatically adds that to the YAML once you cite the first item in your
manuscript. But let’s first open the references.bib file (located in
report&gt;source on your project folder) and understand how citations
are presented there:</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/09-references-bib.png" alt="references.bib" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>A file with the BIB file extension is a BibTeX Bibliographical
Database file. It’s a specially formatted text file that lists
references pertaining to a particular source of information. They’re
normally seen only with the .<code>bib</code> file extension but might
instead use <code>.bibitex</code>. BibTeX files might hold references
for things like research papers, articles, books, etc. The file often
includes an author’s name, year, title, page number, and other related
content. Each item can be edited, in case there is any metadata
incorrect or missing.</p>
<p>Most citation and reference management tools such as Refworks,
Endnote, Mendeley and Zotero, as well as some search engines (e.g.,
Google Scholar), most scientific databases, and our UCSB library catalog
allow us to export citations as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX" class="external-link">.bib or BibteX files</a>.
These files are used to describe and process lists of references, mostly
in conjunction with LaTeX documents. Each .bib file has a citation key
or ID preceded by an <code>@</code>, which uniquely identifies each
item. Citation keys can be customized, as we will learn in a bit, but be
advised that your manuscript will render citations correctly only if you
have the cited item corresponding to its exact key.</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="inserting-citations">Inserting Citations<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#inserting-citations"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Note that we have different blocks in this file, starting with a
<code>@</code> and ending with a curly bracket <code>{</code>, each one
representing a unique citable source. We will now be adding a new item
using the DOI lookup function so that you can see how the magic
works!</p>
<p>Let’s assume you want to include a citation in the first line of the
Value of the Data section because you would like to provide some
reference to how the salivary cortisol technique has been used in
research. So let’s click where we want to insert the citation, call the
citation function, and look for the following DOI: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-012373947-6.00334-2" class="external-link uri">https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-012373947-6.00334-2</a></p>
<figure><img src="../fig/09-salviary-cortisol.png" alt="Salviary Cortisol" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>The DOI lookup uses the <a href="https://perma.cc/KH7N-5Q97" class="external-link">persistent identifier</a>, which
connects to the DOI resolver service and retrieves the .bibtex file with
resource metadata<sup>1</sup>. You should insert the whole DOI address,
including the resolver service, the prefix, and the suffix which is
specific to the resource as illustrated below:</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/09-doi-lookup.png" alt="DOI Lookup" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>Rstudio will search the <a href="https://support.datacite.org/docs/doi-basics" class="external-link">DOI API</a> and list
the only matching result, and you can insert it. After confirming this
is the citation you would like to include, you can modify the key if you
would like to simplify it and also choose if you would like to insert it
as an in-text citation, meaning you would like to have the last name of
the author(s) followed by a page number enclosed in parentheses. i.e.,
Kirschbaum and Hellhammer (2007), but in this case, we will uncheck that
option since we won’t include authors as part of the narrative. Instead,
we would like to insert a parenthetical citation, where authors and year
will be displayed inside the parentheses such as (Kirschbaum and
Hellhammer 2007). You may insert more than one citation by selecting
multiple items.</p>
<p>This item will be automatically listed in your references.bib file
and will help you manage your citations more efficiently. Pretty cool,
huh? If you want to cite this same item again, you can type
<code>@</code> and the first letters of the item name, which will be
auto-completed by Rstudio. You will have to type the key between
brackets for parenthetical citations, and for in-text narrative
citations, you only need to type in the key. Note that when you hover
over the citation, you will preview the full reference for the cited
item that will be listed at the bottom of the manuscript. This feature
helps you to identify if you have to edit anything in the .bib file your
citation is calling. Also, note that all citations will be included at
the end of your document under a reference list.</p>

<p>Inserting citations using Crossref, DataCite, or PubMed follows a
process very similar to the DOI process; however, to search on their
APIs, you must input information accordingly. For Crossref, you may use
keywords and author information to identify an item (e.g., Cortisol
Stress Oken) and Rstudio will connect to <a href="https://search.crossref.org/" class="external-link">Crossref search</a> and provide
related results, often not as specific as the DOI search, for cases you
know exactly what you are looking for. DataCite allows searches by
persistent identifiers or keywords, while PubMed searches exclusively in
biomedical literature indexed in the database. If you have the PMID
(PubMed reference number), which is uniquely assigned by the NIH
National Library of Medicine to papers indexed in PubMed, similarly to
the DOI search, it will save you time.</p>

<p>Not all citations are in perfect shape when we import them. You may
have to adjust them (e.g., include missing metadata and move content to
another metadata field). If needed, we can do so by modifying the .bib
file. As briefly mentioned, you can also edit citation keys. By default,
most citation keys will have the first author’s last name or the first
word of the title (if no authors), followed by the year of publication.
You may consider editing the citation key in case you want to simplify
the entry and speed up the autocomplete option. If you choose to do so,
you can simply click on the key in the .bib file and edit it. Please be
advised to use this option with caution and to update citations to match
the .bib file.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>You might have noticed that all citations are inserted in a specific
style. Can you guess which one? If you answered Chicago, that is
correct! By default, Rstudio uses a Chicago author-date format for
citations and references. To use another style, you will need to specify
a CSL (Citation Style Language) file in the CSL metadata field in the
YAML.</p>
<p>But how can you identify which CSL you should use? You can find
required formats on the <a href="https://www.zotero.org/styles" class="external-link">Zotero
Style Repository</a>, making searching for and downloading your desired
style easy.</p>
<p>Download the format you wish to use and call it out in the YAML. We
have pre-saved the APA CSL file in the project folder for you. But if
you would like to follow the process or try another style, go to the
Zotero Style repo and select <a href="https://www.zotero.org/styles/apa" class="external-link">American Psychological
Association 7th edition</a> or any other style of your choice. It will
automatically download the file (e.g., <code>apa.csl</code>). Make sure
to save it to your project directory in the report/source folder. In the
YAML we have to call the exact name of the file preceded by “csl:”</p>

<p>All cited items will be listed under the section References, which
you created before while practicing headings and subheadings. Items will
be placed automatically in alphabetical order for most citation styles.
However, there might be cases which you will be referencing supporting
literature that you have not necessarily cited in the document.</p>
<p>By default, the bibliography will only display items that are
directly referenced in the document. If you want to include items in the
bibliography without actually citing them in the body text, you can
define a dummy <code>nocite</code> metadata field in the YAML and put
the citations there.</p>

practice. This practice is recommended for giving proper credit to
package developers and also to inform your readers about the exact
version you have used to produce your paper.</p>
<p>Ideally, we would follow this process for all packages we have
installed and used to produce the paper. But for the sake of time, let’s
do that process for the package <strong><em>BayesFactor</em></strong>.
Since we have the option to call R packages right from the insert

<hr class="half-width">
<p>Cross-referencing is a useful way of directing your readers through
your document, and it can be accomplished in Quarto. You may create
cross-references to figures, tables, equations, sections, code listings,
theorems, proofs, and more.</p>
<p>Essentially, every cross-referenceable entity requires a caption
(description), the object info, and a label (unique identifier. Let’s
say we want to cross-reference Figure 1 in the paper. To do so, we will
need to first create an ID for it. If we are in the visual mode, we can
double-click the image, click the “Attributes” tab, and enter #fig1 as
the ID.</p>
<p><img src="../fig/09-inserting-crossref.png" alt="Inserting cross-referencing" class="figure"><br></p>
<p>Alternatively, in the source mode, we can enter that same ID in front
of the figure name, by typing in {#fig-fig1}</p>
<p><code>![Experimental timeline and measurements.](fig/Fig1.jpg){#fig-fig1}</code></p>
<p>Ok, but how can you call that in another part of the paper? You may
enter the key below using the unique identifier, but instead of the hash
<code>#</code>, it should be preceded by an at <code>@</code>:</p>
<p><code>@fig-fig1</code></p>
<p>If you do not start your label with <code>fig-</code>, Quarto will
interpret it as a citation and won’t render correctly. Click
<code>Render</code> and see how it displays.</p>
<p>You may follow a similar approach to add cross-references for
sections <code>(#sec-)/(@sec-)</code>, equations
<code>(#eq-)/(@eq-)</code>, tables <code>(#tbl-)/(@tbl-)</code> and
other objects (see: <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/cross-references.html" class="external-link">Quarto’s
Cross References guide</a>).</p>
<p>If you wish to add a cross-reference to a figure that was generated
via code block, you have to provide a label (id) and a caption at the
beginning of the figure code block.</p>
<pre><code><span><span class="co">#| label: fig-id</span></span>
<span><span class="co">#| fig-cap: "figure caption here" </span></span></code></pre>
<p>And then, enter the <span class="citation">@fig-id</span> where you
want to note the cross-reference in your paper.</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="git-workflow">Git Workflow<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#git-workflow"></a>
</h3>
<p>The most simple workflow for version control (working on your
computer only) is referred to as “add” and “commit”:</p>
<p>But what do those words even mean?</p>
<p><strong>Add:</strong> Choose a file or files to take a “snapshot” of.
What files do you want to add to your next version?</p>
<p><strong>Commit:</strong> Take a “snapshot” of a selected version of
your project. The snapshot will <em>only</em> include the files you
“added”, typically only files that you’ve edited since your last
commit.</p>
<p>You may have just a few commits in a single work session or many
commits.</p>
<p>When you commit, you add a “commit message,” a.k .a. a short line of
text (recommended 50 characters or less) that describes the changes that
were made to the file(s) you added. This helps keep your versions
organized and makes it easier to remember what you did or restore your
work to exactly the version needed if you make a mistake or want to
implement a change.</p>

<h4 id="git-workflow-with-github">Git Workflow with GitHub<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#git-workflow-with-github"></a>
</h4>
<p>If we are saving our work to a version control hosting cloud platform
such as GitHub, our workflow gets a bit more complex, we add a “pull”
and “push” step at the beginning and end of a work session.</p>
<p><code>Pull &gt; add &gt; commit &gt; push</code></p>
<p><strong>Pull:</strong> <em>download</em> the most recent version of
the repository <em>from</em> GitHub <em>to</em> your local computer.</p>
<p><strong>Push:</strong> <em>upload</em> the most recent version of the
repository <em>to</em> GitHub <em>from</em> your local computer.</p>
<p>Put a pin in pulling and pushing for now. For the time being, as we
edit our paper, we will just stick to adding and committing. In the end,
we’ll see how to use push to GitHub, and you can experiment with pulling
later on.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>Earlier, we looked at integrating version control into your RStudio
workflow to help streamline your work and keep track of changes. In this
part of the workshop, we will set up Rstudio to authenticate with
GitHub, which is necessary to <em>push</em> your local changes to the
remote repository on GitHub.</p>
<p>Terminology: Git <em>Push</em> and <em>Pull</em></p>
<p>Definition: The process of synchronizing your local git repository
with your git repository on GitHub (or other Git server).</p>
<p>GitHub requires a more secure method of authentication than a simple
Username and Password. For this workshop, we’ll be using a Personal
Access Token (PAT) method which you will setup for your account on
GitHub. We will configure RStudio to use your PAT to authenticate with
GitHub so you can download and upload your RStudio code edits to
GitHub.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="setting-up-your-github-personal-access-token-pat">Setting up your GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#setting-up-your-github-personal-access-token-pat"></a>
</h3>
<p>In your RStudio console enter following command:</p>
<p><code>usethis::create_github_token()</code></p>
<p>This will open your web browser and, after logging in if necessary,
you’ll be on GitHub settings page to create a PAT. Most of the options
have already been set for us, we only need to update:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Note field by describing what is the token for. We recommend a
combination describing the computer the PAT will be used on and what it
is going to be used for.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>RStudio on MacBookAir for Reproducibility Workshop</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Set expiration to 90 days. Note that GitHub will send you an email
when it’s time to renew your token that is about to expire. It is easier
to not let the token expire, otherwise you will have to regenerate a new
one and do all the setup again.</li>
</ul>
<figure><img src="../fig/10-github-new-PAT-options.png" class="image-with-shadow figure mx-auto d-block" alt="PAT options on GitHub"></figure><p>You can leave all the other options as selected. Click on the green
Generate token button at the bottom of the page.</p>
<ul>
<li>On the next screen GitHub shows you the new token. <strong>Be sure
to copy it</strong> as you only get one chance to see the token text.
This is the only time you will be able to see it, so do not close this
page before you are done with the setup! Copy your PAT to your
clipboard. Return to RStudio and run the following command in the R
console:</li>
</ul>
<p><code>gitcreds::gitcreds_set()</code></p>
<p>This will prompt you to paste the PAT you just copied from GitHub.
Paste your PAT and hit Enter. You you should see a few lines letting you
know that the token has been setup.</p>
<p>To check your work you can run the following command in your R
console:</p>
<p><code>usethis::git_sitrep()</code></p>
<p>if the output shows the line
<code>Personal access token for 'https://github.com': '&lt;discovered&gt;'</code></p>
<p>then you know you’ve succeeded in connecting RStudio with GitHub.</p>
<p>Note that if you use several computers/servers, you will have to do
those steps again on each machine.</p>

<p>If you forked and cloned the demonstration publication for this
workshop, as covered in an earlier episode, then your copy of the
repository should already have the “origin” set. Once the “origin” is
set properly, you should be able to push and pull your changes to and
from GitHub. When you clone a repository from GitHub, your local copy of
the repository should have GitHub set as the “origin”.</p>
<p>You can check this in Rstudio –&gt; Tools –&gt; Project Options –&gt;
Git/SVN</p>
<p>If the “Origin” field is blank, then you’ll need to add it from the
terminal with a couple of terminal commands like this:</p>
<pre><code>git remote add origin &lt;paste your repository address here&gt;
git fetch --set-upstream origin main</code></pre>
<p>Be sure <strong>your</strong> GitHub username is part of the URL.</p>
<p>After you’ve updated the Origin URL from the command line, go back to

<p>Tips for working with Git</p>
<p>You should <em>pull</em> each time you start working on your project
after a hiatus or before each edit if you know a team member is working
at the same time.</p>
<p>At the end of your work session (or more frequently if you are
working at the same time as team members), “<em>push</em>” your commits
to the remote repository - this way your local changes get added to your
team’s remote repository.</p>
<p>This <em>pull</em>, <em>add</em>, <em>commit</em>, <em>push</em>
routine will become second nature. When you sit down to work do a
<em>pull</em> and when you’re about to get up <em>push</em> to establish
a ritual that marks the beginning and end of your work session.</p>
<p>With the ability to synchronize your changes between GitHub and your
local repo, the next step is to explore options for publishing your
research paper.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>Just sharing your code, data, and workflow does not magically make
your research reproducible if we don’t know what language the code is
written in or if functions change or are deprecated in newer versions,
breaking your code.</p>
<p>Therefore, you should ask yourself: * What are the versions of the
packages used for my project? * Will my project be usable on other
systems or in the future? * How do you deal with projects requiring
different versions of a package?</p>
<p>Reproducibility is a spectrum that encompasses several actions. A
first step to help prevent this problem is to carefully document the
hardware and versions of software used in your analyses so that others
can recreate that computing environment if needed.</p>
<p>In R, you can accomplish that by running the
<code>sessionInfo()</code> function. <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/details/vignettes/sessioninfo.html" class="external-link">see
CRAN Docs</a> This will create a snapshot of your computational
environment, including your OS, R session/version, packages, their
versions, and where they were installed from (e.g., CRAN, GitHub, or
local Libraries). This information should be integrated into your README
and project documentation.</p>
<p>After using this function, you will print:</p>
<p>[add image]</p>
<p>Try it yourself and check which versions you are using for each of
the packages you have installed for the workshop.<br>
You may save it as a .txt file and save it in your project folder using
the following command:
<code>sessionInfo() %&gt;% capture.output(file="session_info.txt")</code></p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Assume you have followed all the recommended practices to create
reproducible projects. You chose RStudio/R, a free and open-source
software; you have used relative paths and produced clean and clear
code; your project directory and data files follow name conventions and
are well-organized and beautifully documented. You have also documented
your computational environment, as advised above.</p>
<p>Is that all? Well, not quite. Imagine investing significant time and
effort into completing sophisticated data analysis, only to face a
frustrating situation. When R gets upgraded and new package versions are
released, everything suddenly starts crashing down. How can you ensure
that the packages you rely on for your project remain on the same
version consistently, even in the future?</p>
<p>One common reproducibility issue in research relates to software
dependencies. “Dependency hell” is a colloquial term used to describe a
situation in software development where the complex web of dependencies
between different software components becomes difficult to manage or
resolve. It typically occurs when multiple software libraries or
packages have conflicting or incompatible requirements regarding the
versions of other libraries or packages they rely on.</p>
<p>If you can only install one version of the shared software or
library, you may have to find newer or older versions of the other
software packages. But doing so can create more problems because those
new versions might not work with other software you have installed,
causing problems for your code to break and your publications not to
render things correctly.</p>
<p>Let’s say you’re working on a data analysis project and have two R
packages you’re using: “package X” and “package Y.”</p>
<p><code>"package X" version 1.0.0 depends on "package Z" version 2.0.0. "package Y" version 1.5.0 depends on "package Z" version 1.0.0.</code></p>
<p>You start your project by installing the latest versions of both
packages. At this point, everything works fine, and you can proceed with
your analysis using both packages. However, a few months later, you must
reproduce your analysis and reinstall the packages. Unknown to you,
“package Z” has been updated since your last installation, and the new
version is incompatible with the older version that “package Y” depends
on. When you try to run your analysis, you encounter errors or
unexpected behavior because “package Y” is no longer compatible with the
updated version of “package Z.” This mismatch in dependencies can result
in reproducibility issues, making it challenging to replicate your
previous results.</p>
<p>You may think I can still look at the <code>sessionInfo()</code> .txt
file and install older packages to make things work again, right? Well,
that will require some extra work and affect your other projects that
may rely the same packages with different versions. In this case, we
need to take an additional action avoid this problem.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>R/RStudio offers a vast ecosystem of packages and libraries that
cater to a wide range of data manipulation, visualization, and analysis
needs. However, harnessing the full potential of R often involves
juggling a multitude of dependencies, which can lead to complex
versioning issues, compatibility challenges, and time-consuming
troubleshooting.</p>
<p>This is where Groundhog comes to the rescue! Groundhog (<a href="https://groundhogr.com" class="external-link uri">https://groundhogr.com</a>)
was designed to streamline and simplify R dependency management. With
Groundhog, R users can effortlessly tackle the intricacies of package
installations, version control, and environment isolation, making it the
go-to solution for researchers seeking to optimize their R workflow.</p>

automatically handle the installation and loading of required packages

<li><p>It gives real-time feedback when each package is loaded,

<hr class="half-width">
<p>The <code>groundhog. library()</code> loads packages &amp; their
dependencies as available on a chosen date on CRAN. Packages get
automatically installed if needed. Installation keeps, rather than
replaces, existing versions of that package.</p>

</h3>
<p>The first step is to choose a date. Think of it as setting the stage
for your coding, having as a starting point the first day of the month.
In that case, you load all the essential packages tailored to that
chosen date before creating your code:</p>
<p><code>{r} # Imagine we're in 2023-12-01 library(groundhog) pkgs &lt;- c(pkg1, pkg2, pkg3, pkg4) groundhog.library(pkgs, '2023-12-01')</code></p>
<p>The advantage of this approach? When you run or make any edits to
your script in the future, you can stick with your original date choice
or update that by changing that date accordingly.</p>
<p>And if you’re going all out with multiple
<code>groundhog.library()</code> calls, you can set the date as a
variable, making your script even more dynamic.</p>
<p><code>{r} groundhog.day &lt;- '2023-12-01' groundhog.library(pkgs, groundhog.day)</code></p>

<h3 id="using-groundhog-in-existing-scripts">Using GroundHog in Existing Scripts<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#using-groundhog-in-existing-scripts"></a>
</h3>
<p>Assume you developed a script months ago before you knew Groundhog
even existed. The good news is that you can still apply it
retroactively. To do so, you will need to set a
<code>groundhog day</code> and adjust the library loading to
<code>groundhog.library</code>. The key question is: what date should
you choose? We advise you to try the date the script was created or last
saved as a proxy. If the documentation includes that information, go for
it and test if things will render correctly. If not, try a month before
or later, and it should work. See why documenting your work matters? We
want to avoid guessing games.</p>

<p>Groundhog is only one solution to help you circumvent the dependency

<p>Once you have completed your Quarto manuscript following all the best
practices for reproducibility, including organizing your project files,
what is next? The answer depends on your plans to move forward. Let’s
explore some scenarios:</p>

<h4 id="publishing-with-rpubs">Publishing with RPubs<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#publishing-with-rpubs"></a>
</h4>
<p>The easiest way would be to use <a href="https://rpubs.com/" class="external-link">RPubs</a>, which is integrated with Rstudio.
RPubs is a bare-bones, free web hosting service. It provides no other
services; meaning, no support for search, collaboration, persistent
identifiers, or versioning. But, it is the simplest and most direct way
of getting your R Markdown (and now Quarto) document published on the
web directly from RStudio. For a more full-featured hosting service,
consider GitHub and GitHub Pages, which will be described later.</p>
<p>Notice the circular blue “Publish” button in the upper right corner
of your <em>Render</em> output. Click this to publish to RPubs. It is
worthnoting, that this process requires a Rregistration This is where
you’ll need a Rpubs account, as mentioned in <a href="index.html#setup">setup</a> for this workshop.</p>
<p>Click the blue publish button:</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/11-publish-button-scrnshot-2.png" alt="Publish button in RStudio" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>Wait for the installation to be completed. If a little menu pops up,
select “Publish Document…” and you’ll be presented with the following
panels:</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/11-r-studio-knit-publish-to-scrnshot.png" alt="Publish to RPubs or RStudio Connect" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>(The other option in the dialog box, RStudio Connect, is a standalone
publishing platform for teams to share content. It requires a purchase
to host and use.)</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/11-r-studio-knit-publish-confirm-scrnshot.png" alt="Confirm Publish to RPubs" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>The first time you publish, RStudio will likely ask if you want to
install some needed packages; say yes. RStudio will then open up a web
browser to allow you to sign in to rpubs.com.</p>
<p>At the end of the publishing process, your paper will be live on the
internet with a URL similar to:
<code>https://rpubs.com/yourname/678624</code></p>
<p>RStudio also saves an HTML version of your <em>knit</em> document to
your local file system. Look for it in the same directory as the Quarto
file in your R-Studio project directory. This html document is
self-contained and highly portable. Images are encoded directly into the
HTML so you can easily move it to any web hosting you have
available.</p>

<h4 id="publishing-with-quarto-pub">Publishing with Quarto Pub<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#publishing-with-quarto-pub"></a>
</h4>
<p><a href="https://quartopub.com/" class="external-link">Quarto Pub</a> is a free publishing
service ideal for publishing blogs, course or project websites, books,
presentations, and personal hobby sites developed in Quarto. All
documents and sites published to Quarto Pub are publicly visible, so be
mindful you should only publish content you wish to share publicly.
Also, there is a limit of 100 MB per publication and a soft limit of 10
GB per month.</p>
<p>There are two approaches to publish content to Quarto Pub:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Use the <code>quarto publish</code> command to publish content
rendered on your local machine</li>
</ol>
<p>or</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>If you are using GitHub, you can use a GitHub Action to render your
project automatically and publish the resulting content whenever your
code changes.</li>
</ol>
<p>As we are getting started, we will briefly cover only the first
approach. To explore the second option, check <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/quarto-pub.html" class="external-link">Quarto Pub’s
documentation</a>.</p>
<div class="section level5">
<h5 id="publish-command">Publish Command<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#publish-command"></a>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>From the directory where your project is located, execute the quarto
publish command for Quarto Pub, type:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>quarto publish quarto-pub your-document.qmd</code></p>
<p>In our case, that would be
<code>quarto publish quarto-pub DataPaper-ReproducibilityWorkshop.qmd</code>.
But wait, first, we have to ensure we are using the right path to call
the document, which is in the report folder. So, we can type in the
terminal <code>cd report</code> before proceeding.</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/11-quartopub-publishcommand.png" alt="Quarto Pub Publish command" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>As it is our first time publishing in Quarto Pub, the command
above will prompt you to authenticate. We will need to confirm the
authorization and create a Quarto Pub account to first.</p></li>
<li><p>Then, you will be offered the option to change the document type
if you’d like. After the confirmation, there will be some action on the
terminal to render the document, which will be published in Quarto
Pub.</p></li>
</ol>

<h4 id="publishing-as-website-on-github">Publishing as website on GitHub<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#publishing-as-website-on-github"></a>
</h4>
<p>Another better but slightly more involved option for publishing a
Quarto document on the web is to use GitHub and GitHub Pages. We have
already seen how RStudio has built-in support for pushing your RStudio
project to GitHub. To enable publishing to GitHub Pages, the website
publication companion to GitHub, go to your repository’s Settings page
on GitHub and select a branch (“branch” is a repository term) to
publish. Name your main Quarto file <code>index.qmd</code>, and render
it to HTML as <code>index.html</code>. With GitHub Pages enabled on your
repository, the HTML file in your repository at <a href="https://github.com/myusername/myrepo/index.html" class="external-link uri">https://github.com/myusername/myrepo/index.html</a> will
appear on the web as <a href="https://myusername.github.io/" class="external-link uri">https://myusername.github.io/</a>.</p>

<h4 id="other-document-types">Other document types<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#other-document-types"></a>

<p>When you create a new Quarto file in R Studio recall that you are
presented with a choice of Output Formats:</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/02-name-new-qmd.PNG" alt="RStudio output formats" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>For the purposes of this workshop, we’ve been using HTML as the
output format, but other types are available. You can render your Quarto
as a document, a presentation or a <em>Shiny</em> app. With the default
installation of RStudio HTML output is most likely to work. Other
formats may require additional R packages and/or code libraries be
installed on your computer. RStudio also has a templating system to help
with creating Quarto files with common elements, YAML metadata and
rendering instructions. This can be very helpful, for example, if you
want to create a weekly or monthly report documenting an ongoing
experiment, study, or other changing data.</p>

</h3>
<ul>
<li>Most journals now request the underlying data, code, and
documentation to be shared along with the manuscript, so in that case,
you will have that handy. Whenever possible, give preference to
<em>open-access</em> journals with data sharing recommendations to
foster open science, transparency, and research reproducibility.</li>
<li>If your chosen journal does not require nor recommend a particular
process for making your project data available (some will dictate what,
where and how project data should be uploaded), you may still consider

<p>We have learned how to start a new document on RStudio and will learn
good practices for project organization next. But let’s say you are
writing a paper having a journal in mind. Writing it in your style and
then formatting it before submission will duplicate your work, right?
The good news is that RStudio and Quarto can give us a hand with
that.</p>
<p>Quarto offers some journal formats and made them available within the
quarto-journals GitHub organization, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Association of Computing Machinery</li>
<li>American Chemical Society</li>
<li>Biophysical journal</li>
<li>Elsevier Journals</li>
<li>American Statistical Association Journals</li>
<li>Journal of Statistical Software</li>
<li>Public Library of Science</li>
</ul>
<p>This list is expected to grow rapidly with new contributions
submitted to the <a href="https://github.com/quarto-journals" class="external-link">Quarto
Journal Templates Repository</a>. You may also create your own templates
following <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/journals/templates.html" class="external-link">these
guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>Journal templates require features of Quarto version 1.2, so we must
ensure we have the right version. You can check your Quarto version in
the Terminal with the command: <code>quarto --version</code>. We should
be good with that for this workshop, but if you are using a lab computer
later on, you may need to update Quarto. See: <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/download/release.html" class="external-link">release versions of
Quarto</a></p>
<p>Quarto uses a template command that can be called in the terminal to
create an article in any of these formats. Suppose you want to use the
Elsevier template. In Rstudio, in the terminal (if not showing, select
<code>Tools &gt; Terminal &gt; New</code>), type
<code>quarto use template quarto-journals/elsevier</code>. Then, follow
the steps below:</p>
<ul>
<li><ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Trust the authors:
<code>? Do you trust the authors of this template (Y/n) › Yes</code>
</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Give a name to the directory
<code>? Directory name: › elsevier-template</code>
</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<p>This will install the extension and create an example qmd file and
bibliography with all required files that you can use as a starting
place for your article:</p>
<p><img src="../fig/03-journal-template.png" alt="Journal-Templates" class="figure"><br></p>
<p>Locate the directory where you have saved the template. You can make
a copy of <code>elsevier-template.qmd</code> document or rename it as
start writing your paper following the journal’s formatting
requirements.</p>
<p>It is beyond the scope of this workshop to cover journal templates
more extensively, but if you want to explore further how to apply
templates, apply styling and even create your own templates, check the

<hr class="half-width">
<p>Assume you have followed all the recommended practices to create
reproducible projects. You chose RStudio/R, a free and open-source
software; you have used relative paths, and produced clean and clear
code; your project directory and data files follow name conventions and
are well-organized and beautifully documented. Is that all? Well,
almost, but not quite.</p>
<p>Imagine investing significant time and effort into completing
sophisticated data analysis, only to face a frustrating situation. When
R gets upgraded, and new package versions are released, everything
suddenly comes crashing down. How can you ensure that the packages you
rely on for your project remain on the same version consistently, even
in the future?</p>
<p>One common reproducibility issue in research relates to software
dependencies. “Dependency hell” is a coloquial term used to describe a
situation in software development where the complex web of dependencies
between different software components becomes difficult to manage or
resolve. It typically occurs when multiple software libraries or
packages have conflicting or incompatible requirements regarding the
versions of other libraries or packages they rely on.</p>
<p>If you can only install one version of the shared software or
library, you may have to find newer or older versions of the other
software packages. But doing so can create more problems because those
new versions might not work with other software you have installed,
causing problems for your code to break and your publications not to
render things correctly.</p>
<p>Let’s say you’re working on a data analysis project and have two R
packages you’re using: “package X” and “package Y.”</p>
<p><code>"package X" version 1.0.0 depends on "package Z" version 2.0.0. "package Y" version 1.5.0 depends on "package Z" version 1.0.0.</code></p>
<p>You start your project by installing the latest versions of both
packages. At this point, everything works fine, and you can proceed with
your analysis using both packages. However, a few months later, you must
reproduce your analysis and reinstall the packages. Unknown to you,
“package Z” has been updated since your last installation, and the new
version is incompatible with the older version that “package Y” depends
on. When you try to run your analysis, you encounter errors or
unexpected behavior because “package Y” is no longer compatible with the
updated version of “package Z.” This mismatch in dependencies can result
in reproducibility issues, making it challenging to replicate your
previous results.</p>
<p>Therefore, you should ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the versions of the packages used for my project?</li>
<li>Will my project be usable on other systems or in the future?</li>
<li>How to deal with projects requiring different versions of a
package?</li>
</ul></section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="enhancing-reproducibility-with-renv">Enhancing reproducibility with renv<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#enhancing-reproducibility-with-renv"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>To mitigate dependency issues, it’s important to maintain a record of
the package versions used in your analysis and create a reproducible
environment, and that’s where the renv package comes in!</p>
<p>Renv enables you to maintain the specific versions of packages your
project depends on, ensuring their stability and compatibility
throughout its lifecycle by freezing package versions, and protecting
your project from unexpected issues or incompatibilities that may arise
from updates. In other words, it allows you to create isolated
project-specific environments that capture specific versions of
packages, ensuring that the same versions are used every time you
reproduce your work. This makes it easy for a downstream user to run an
R project in the same environment in which it was originally developed.
In sum, there are three main advantages of using renv:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Isolation: Each project gets its own library of R packages. In
this way, you can upgrade and change package versions in one project
without worrying about your other projects.</p></li>
<li><p>Portability: You can more easily share and collaborate on
projects while ensuring all are sharing the same common base, by sharing
a lockfile (renv.lock) which captures the state of your R
packages.</p></li>
<li><p>Reproducibility: You can restore your R library exactly as
specified in the renv.lock file.</p></li>
</ul></section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="how-does-renv-work">How does renv work?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#how-does-renv-work"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Let’s first understand how the R system typically handles packages
you install to use in your project. A package is a collection of
functions, data, and compiled code in a well-defined format, while
libraries are the location where packages live. You may have multiple
projects with different dependencies when using R, but calling packages
from the same library. By default, we have two libraries, System and
User:</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/renv-fig1.png" alt="Understanding how the R System works" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>The problem with this approach is that, most likely, you will be
handling multiple projects in different points in time and with unique
dependencies. Every time you start a fresh project and use the
<code>install.packages()</code> function in R, you will be grabbing the
latest version of a given package available in CRAN or another
repository and re-installing it, replacing the package in your
environment, and potentially causing issues when you re-run your code
and render your Quarto documents using earlier versions of that same
package.</p>
<p>Renv creates a local project library for each project encapsulating
dependencies so you can easily re-run results for each project using the
original versions of packages.</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/renv-fig2.png" alt="Project local library" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure></section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="using-renv">Using renv<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#using-renv"></a>

<h3 id="starting-a-new-project">Starting a new project<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#starting-a-new-project"></a>
</h3>
<p>Now that you know about renv we always recommend you always set it up
when starting a new project. There are different ways to accomplish
that.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>When creating a new project using the new project wizard, make sure
to select the option <code>Use renv with this project</code>:</li>
</ol>
<figure><img src="../fig/renv-fig3.png" alt="Renv for new project" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>If you missed the step described above but suddenly realized you
would rather not continue without renv, don’t worry. You may also enable
renv by clicking Tools&gt;Project Options…&gt;Environments and selecting
to use renv for this project:</li>
</ol>
<figure><img src="../fig/renv-fig4.png" alt="Environments" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Another alternative is to install the renv package, then load it and
run the <code>renv::init()</code> command in the console pane:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code><span><span class="fu">install.packages</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="st">"renv"</span><span class="op">)</span></span>
<span><span class="kw">library</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">renv</span><span class="op">)</span></span>
<span><span class="fu">renv</span><span class="fu">::</span><span class="fu">init</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>This creates the initial <code>renv.lock</code> file. The renv.lock
is a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file generated in the project
directory, which records the precise versions of each package that was
installed, along with other metadata such as package sources and
checksums. The example below helps us to understand the anatomy of a
renv.lock file:</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/renv-fig4.png" alt="Anatomy of a renv.lock file" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>This process will also create a <code>.Rprofile</code>, which is used
to activate renv for new R sessions, and an renv folder containing the
files specified below:</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/renv-fig6.png" alt="Renv" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>What if you need to update packages for your project? Then, whenever
you start using a new package (or otherwise change your project’s
dependencies), run <code>renv::snapshot()</code> to update the lockfile.
Finally, if you are using git and start using renv, you will notice that
renv creates several files and directories in addition to
<code>renv.lock</code>. When done, you should commit the files to your
project’s git repository.</p>

<h3 id="restoring-an-existing-project-using-renv">Restoring an existing project using renv<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#restoring-an-existing-project-using-renv"></a>
</h3>
<p>Every time you open a project for which renv has been set up, renv
automatically runs and checks that the package versions you have
installed on your computer match those of the project. If they match,
there is nothing to do (perhaps that was the case for you today). But if
there are any mismatches (as might have happened to you today), renv
will print a warning resembling the following:</p>
<pre><code>* Project '~/Desktop/myproject' loaded. [renv 0.16.0]
* The project library is out of sync with the lockfile.
* Use `renv::restore()` to install packages recorded in the lockfile.</code></pre>
<p>If this happens, simply run <code>renv::restore()</code> from the
console pane to download and install the package versions needed to
match the project’s requirements. For example, if the project uses
tidyverse 1.3.2 and you have an older version tidyverse 1.3.1 installed
on your computer, renv will upgrade your RStudio installation to
tidyverse 1.3.2. (This works conversely as well: if the project uses an
older version of a package you have installed, renv will attempt to
download and install the older version for you. Don’t worry about losing
the newer version. renv ensures that all versions of all packages remain
installed on your computer, available for use by projects as
needed).</p>
<p>In sum, in order to collaborate using renv, one should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initialize renv using <code>renv::init( )</code>
</li>
<li>Share project sources (data and code), and include
<code>renv.lock</code>, <code>.Rprofile</code>, and
<code>renv/activate.R</code> to ensure that collaborators download and
install the right version of renv when starting the project.</li>
<li>When a collaborator opens the project, renv will automatically
bootstrap and download the appropriate version of renv.</li>
<li>If updates are made save them with
<code>renv::snapshot( )</code>
</li>
<li>After that, collaborators can use <code>renv::restore( )</code> to
restore the project library on their machine.</li>
