title: "Instructor Notes"
---
- During Introduction or Episode 1 reiterate that having a Github account is required for this workshop. Any learners who have not yet signed up for a Github account should do so during the first break of the workshop.
- During Episode 2, it might not be clear to all learners the distinction between the console and the terminal. So, we recommend instructors ensure they cover this difference: "in console, is how you submit command to and interact with with R through RStudio, in terminal, you submit commands to and interact with your machine as a whole".
- During Episode 3, when the option to produce pdf outputs using TinyTex is presented, instructors should clarify that it requires extra installation that is separate from the lesson. Instructors may choose to demonstrate the PDF on the side. If you choose so, please make sure to install TinyTex following the same approach you used to install quarto (command line vs. console). If you installed quarto through the RStudio IDE, then quarto will only be on your path if you run the integrated RStudio IDE terminal
- During Episode 9, remember learners that Zotero will be only enabled for those who have an account. 
- Also on Episode 9, some learners may experience issues with the DOI lookup feature. This seems to be a bug with the IDE, or some underlying unreliability of the services providing the DOIs. See open issue: https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/issues/9863
