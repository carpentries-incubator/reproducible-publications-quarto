title: "Instructor Notes"
---
- The project example folder is a simplified version of the original project available at: https://osf.io/6mvq7. We kept only files that are used in the episodes to make it less confusing to learners navigating multiple folders that won't be used in the lesson. You are welcome to use the more complete version if you would like to show some additional examples.
- All Episodes, whenever possible, emphasize using RStudio GUI features over R commands (e.g., install packages using GUI dialog) in order to minimize cognitive overload. Less for learners to remember, and they can always see commands echoed in the console.
- During Introduction or Episode 1 reiterate that having a Github account is required for this workshop. Any learners who have not yet signed up for a Github account should do so during the first break of the workshop.
- During Episode 2, it might need to be clarified to all learners the distinction between the console and the terminal. So, we recommend that instructors cover this difference: "using the console, you submit commands to and interact with R through RStudio; whereas the terminal provides command line access to the computer's operating system". 
- During Episode 3, when the option to produce pdf outputs using TinyTex is presented, instructors should clarify that it requires extra installation that is separate from the lesson. Instructors may choose to demonstrate the PDF on the side. If you choose so, please make sure to install TinyTex following the same approach you used to install quarto (command line vs. console). If you installed quarto through the RStudio IDE, then quarto will only be on your path if you run the integrated RStudio IDE terminal
- During Episode 5, when creating a project from GitHub, mention or quickly show that they also have the option to create a new project from scratch and set up a GitHub repository. If there is time, and depending on the entry knowledge level of the cohort, there could be some more explanation on the differences between these two. 
- During Episode 9, remember learners that Zotero will be only enabled for those who have an account. 
- Also on Episode 9, some learners may experience issues with the DOI lookup feature. This seems to be a bug with the IDE, or some underlying unreliability of the services providing the DOIs. See open issue: https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/issues/9863
