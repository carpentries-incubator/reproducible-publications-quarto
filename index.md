This workshop explores the powerful combination of Quarto and RStudio to author scientific publications. We aim to enhance researchers' adoption of open and reproducible practices while improving their project and data management skills.
This workshop is structured into three modules. The modular format encourages instructors to view the workshop as a comprehensive but flexible curriculum, allowing them to focus on specific areas of interest. Recognizing variations in proficiency levels and familiarity with RStudio among learners, we have designed this workshop to be flexible, allowing for the abbreviation or skipping of episodes to cater to specific needs:

> Module 1 - Reproducibility and Project Organization: This module consists of two episodes (1. Scientific reproducibility: What is it for?, and 2. Good Practices for Managing Projects in RStudio) which introduce learners to reproducible research and project management fundamentals. It lays the groundwork for a robust and transparent workflow, ensuring that all participants, whether beginners or those seeking a refresher, are on the same page before delving into the specifics of Quarto and RStudio Posit.
> 
> Module 2 - Quarto and RStudio: This module focuses on Quarto and its features for creating dynamic and reproducible documents. We guide learners through the ins and outs of Quarto, helping them harness this authoring framework and the tool's potential to create visually appealing, easily reproducible, and shareable documents. This central module forms the bulk of the workshop, consisting of eight sessions that guide participants from the fundamentals of RStudio to advanced Quarto document features. Participants will build practical skills for creating reproducible, well-structured documents, including integrating code, styling content, managing projects, and handling references. Episodes included in this module are: 3. Navigating RStudio and Quarto Documents, 4. Working with Projects in RStudio, 5. Introduction to Working with Quarto Documents, 6. Writing and Styling Qmd Documents, 7. Adding Code to Quarto Documents, 8. Rendering & Customizing Code Outputs, 9. Advanced Code Chunk Options, and 10. Bibliography, Citations & Cross-Referencing 
> 
> Module 3 - Collaboration: This final module includes the remaining file episodes (i.e., 11. Using Git in RStudio, 12. Collaborating via GitHub, 13. Managing Dependencies in R/RStudio, 14. Publishing your project, 15. Creating and sharing reproducible environments with renv) shifts the focus to collaboration and publishing. It explores effective collaboration with others, using version control within RStudio, pushing local changes to a remote repository, managing dependencies for R/Quarto projects, and sharing reproducible research with a broader audience.
