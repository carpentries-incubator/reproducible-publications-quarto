Participants will build on their research and analytical skills with R Studio by learning how to create reproducible documents that combine code, analysis and narrative. RStudio makes it possible to work on a complete research project in a more efficient, integrated and organized manner: from data upload, cleaning, and analysis, to writing and styling a manuscript in markdown. It allows users to add code, figures, citations, and bibliography, as well as to generate outputs in various formats (e.g., html, pdf, doc). Rstudio also connects with Git and Github and learners will have a chance to experiment with this integration and understand its advantages for collaboration and version control. This workshop will involve lectures and demos alternating with hands-on exercises and challenges, so by the end of the workshop, learners will have “authored” a reproducible paper of your own with the data and narrative we provide.
