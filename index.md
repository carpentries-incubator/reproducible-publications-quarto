Participants will build on using their R data analysis skills in R Studio by learning how to create R Markdown documents that combine analysis and narrative. R Markdown makes it possible to work on a whole research project from within R Studio in an easily reproducible manner: from data upload, cleaning, and analysis, to writing your paper, adding figures, citations, and bibliography with proper formatting. R markdown allows you to output your work as .html, .pdf, .docx (among many other formats). This workshop will involve lectures and demos alternating with hands-on exercises, so by the end of the workshop, you will have “authored” a reproducible paper of your own with the data and narrative we provide.
