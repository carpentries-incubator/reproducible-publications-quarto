Participants will build on using their R data analysis skills in R Studio by learning how to create reproducible documents that combine analysis and narrative. RStudio makes it possible to work on a whole research project in a more efficient and organized manner: from data upload, cleaning, and analysis, to writing and styling your paper in R Markdown, adding coding, figures, citations, and bibliography, which can generate outputs in various formats (e.g., html, pdf, doc). Rstudio also connects with Git and Github and learners will have a chance to experiment with this integration and understand their advantages. This workshop will involve lectures and demos alternating with hands-on exercises, so by the end of the workshop, you will have “authored” a reproducible paper of your own with the data and narrative we provide.
