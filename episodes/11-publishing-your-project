## And Now What is Next?

Once you have completed your rmd manuscript following all the best practices for reproducibility, including organizing your project files what is next? 
The answer depends on your plans to move forward. Let's explore some scenarios:
1) If you are willing to publish through a peer-reviewed journal: Give preference to open-access journals which foster open science and research reproducibility.
You may consider submitting it to a journal in your field for peer-review. Most journals now request the data and code to be shared along with the manuscript, so in that case you will have that handy. 
You can download the paper in the desired format and submit it along with your `rproject`, so that peers reviewers will be able to inspect your underlying data.  
You may deposit the data and code in a general repository such as Zenodo or Fighsare, a disciplinary or institutional repository.
