### Using R projects and version control in RStudio

It's a two step process to work on a project in RStudio with version control. First step is to make sure your work is set up as an R Project. Secondly, and optionally, when you set up your project you can have the option to add versioning (or continue from an existing version-controlled project). 

#### Starting an R Project

There are several options for working with R projects in RStudio. If you aren't already working in an R Project, you can create a new one. There are three options here:
1. **New Directory** - start a brand new R project .
2. **Existing Directory** - add exisiting work to a R project.
3. **Version Control** Continue an existing R project that already uses version control (i.e. download from GitHub)

The third option would be a project already under version control but options 1 and 2 will also give you the opportunity to use or add versioning to the project. Let's see how that would work. 

#### Starting a R Project with Version Control

![new r project options](../fig/05-new-project.PNG)

To start an R project, you would navigate to `File > new project` rather than just `File > new file`. 

After choosing "New Directory" chose "new project" on the next menu options. Then, to use version control, make sure to check the box as highlighted:
![new project w/ version control](../fig/05-brand-new-project.PNG)

*Note when you choose directory name, it will create a new directory in the directory you specified along with an .Rproj file of the same name. Avoid spaces here. underscores "_", dashes "-" or camel case "NewProject" is the recommended way to name this directory/file.

*Optionally, check the box next to Open in new session if you want it to appear in a new RStudio window. 

#### Add versioning to an existing project

We won't take the time to cover that here, but if you've already started an R project WITHOUT version control, you have the option to add version control retrospectively. You can also add existing R files to a project and version control if you've done neither. To see a tutorial of this process,  please see episode from x lesson here: FIXME add link
This is by far the most labor intensive way to do it, so remember to add version control at the beginning of any new project (even if you get lazy and don't even use it).

#### Continue a version-controlled project
The final option is to continue a version controlled project. This is the option we will do.

## Our turn!

But first, we need to navigate to GitHub and make a copy of the project for this workshop -> FIXME add instructions. 


Woo hoo! We have the project we are collaborating on for this workshop open in a new RStudio session!

Let’s take a second to pause and look at our materials in the folders to acquaint ourselves with them.
Now, how to use version control. 

### Using version control

The most simple workflow for version control (working on your computer only)
is referred to as "add" and "commit": 

But what do those words even mean?

add: definition  
Commit: definition 


If we are saving our work to a version control hosting cloud platform such as GitHub, 
our workflow gets a bit more complex, we add a "pull" and "push" step at the beginning and end of a work session. 

Pull > add > commit > push


Pull: definition  
 
Push: definition  

### Tips for working with Git

- You should pull each time you start working on your project after a hiatus, or before each edit if you know a team member is working at the same time. 
- Commit frequently, each commit should be a distinct set of edits which you can summarize in 50 characters or less. Don’t add a bunch of unrelated edits to the same commit, it makes it harder to look back through your “snapshots” and find the right one if you need to. 
- At the end of your work session (or more frequently if you are working at the same time as team members), “push” your commits to the remote repository - this is the only way your local changes get added to your team’s remote repository.

This pull, add, commit, push routine will become second nature. Pulling at the beginning and pushing at the end of your work session becomes a sort of ritual that marks the beginning and end of your work session.

Make a commit when you’re done with a message that is descriptive of the edits made.
